Fiscal Year 2024

Geoff Martha
Chairman & CEO August 26, 2024 As we celebrate Medtronic’s 75th anniversary and honor our legacy of breakthrough innovation, we are looking ahead with excitement and determination. It’s an incredible time to be at the nexus of healthcare and technology — and even with our long legacy of advancements, we’re just getting started. We’re experiencing a time of exponential change — and the possibilities for revolutionizing healthcare through cutting-edge technology and novel partnerships are limitless. The future holds immense potential, and Medtronic is uniquely positioned to continue making a profound impact in healthcare and for society.
Propelling healthcare into a bold, new era Since its founding, Medtronic has introduced a steady stream of groundbreaking innovation that has revolutionized patient care worldwide. Leveraging our engineering expertise and deep understanding of the human body, we continuously create and enhance new approaches to care. In 1957, we invented the world’s first battery-powered, portable pacemaker, and have never stopped innovating — and disrupting — that therapy. Today, Medtronic is leading the way in the global adoption of leadless pacing.
Our legacy of invention and market creation endures, evident throughout our diverse portfolio. You see it in Pulsed Field Ablation (PFA), where we’re at one of those moments in MedTech where new technologies are causing a rapid shift in the treatment of disease. You see it in significant advancements in battery technologies, sensing capabilities and enhanced connectivity across many devices. We are applying these developments to address a multitude of clinical conditions, from managing diabetes where closed-loop technology is almost mimicking a human pancreas to managing debilitating neurological disorders like Parkinson’s where technology captures valuable data and insights to individualize therapy. Our first closed-loop spinal cord stimulator is transforming the way we treat chronic pain by automatically sensing and adjusting stimulation, 50 times a second, 24/7, with no required interaction from the patient. Sensing and closed-loop technology is becoming foundational. It is reinvigorating markets, and we have a clear lead.
Medtronic is also using technology to address conditions that were historically only managed by medicines. For example, hypertension affects more than 1 billion people globally. In the U.S. alone, only 1 in 4 adults have their hypertension under control despite numerous classes of pharmaceuticals. Breakthrough therapies like our Symplicity™ blood pressure procedure, which received FDA approval in FY24, have a meaningful role to play in augmenting traditional approaches.
Technology is bridging gaps in care In an era where the healthcare industry is rapidly evolving, the demand for quality care is outpacing the available workforce.
This makes the need for reliable, scalable technology solutions that enhance the efficiency of procedures more critical than ever. Medtronic's legacy and continuous innovation provide the stability and pioneering technology that healthcare providers rely on. Our advantage lies in integrating technology with our expansive suite of services to meet the complex demands of modern medicine and people around the globe.
Technology is a pivotal ally in bridging healthcare gaps. It is the path forward to solving today’s healthcare challenges. An aging population, a global shortfall in healthcare professionals, and rapidly rising healthcare costs create a perfect storm, underscoring the urgent need for more innovative and efficient solutions. A study published in The Lancet1 estimates that by 2030, the global shortage of health workers could reach 10 million, exacerbated by factors such as migration, burnout, and inadequate training, with disproportionate impacts in developing nations. Medtronic is at the forefront of leveraging technology to democratize quality healthcare, working toward the goal of ensuring that advanced care can reach all corners of 1 The Lancet: Prioritising the health and care workforce shortage: protect, invest, together; https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214109X(23)00224-3

the globe, regardless of local staffing constraints or socioeconomic status. Technology will never replace people, but it is a critical enabler to bridge the ever-widening gaps.
In India – and everywhere – challenges and solutions abound Let me give you an example. In the spring, I visited a world-class hospital in India, overwhelmed by the sheer number of patients and their families. It was a chaotic scene with people everywhere — picture an enormous hall, densely packed with people, desperately waiting for care: a familiar sight to anyone who is in the healthcare field these days. Hospital executives explained they see this same scene every day — the magnitude of need far outweighs their capacity, even at this state-of-the- art institution with more resources than most. It’s a simple matter of numbers: too many patients, too few doctors.
But on another floor at that same hospital was a long corridor of cancer screening suites, each equipped with AI from our GI Genius™ intelligent endoscopy module to augment traditional colon cancer screenings. Staffing the suites were young clinicians with only a few years of training. The AI at their fingertips served as another set of eyes trained to find the most minuscule, hard-to-detect polyps — particularly difficult to see when you’re an exhausted doctor, on a double shift, who has read dozens of scans that day.
Leaning on this new technology, these new docs were able to deliver similar outcomes for their patients as the world’s leading GI doctors, and as a result, one of the world’s most treatable cancers is being caught earlier for many more people. The technology is leveling the playing field in Endoscopy and elsewhere. For example, the AI-powered “driver assist” technology for surgical robots that we are developing guides doctors through procedures, similar to the colonoscopy tech. And, in more complicated surgeries, AI will help the physicians make the right decisions every step of the way, and each plan is customized for that individual patient. This approach can democratize high quality surgery — high quality healthcare — for people all over the world.
The transformative power of technology in healthcare is revolutionizing access to medical services, making it more equitable than ever before. Imagine patients in remote or underserved areas receiving expert consultations and continuous care right from their homes, thanks to telemedicine and mobile health apps. This innovation is a game-changer, especially in regions where healthcare professionals are few and far between. Medtronic’s dedication to integrating these cutting-edge technologies embodies our vision of a world where everyone, no matter where they live, can access the healthcare they deserve.
Going beyond devices to deliver patient-centric solutions and ecosystems of care The MedTech industry is evolving from a focus on individual devices to comprehensive solutions: a shift that’s truly impacting patient outcomes and enhancing clinicians’ experiences. For example, in our spine business, by integrating best-in-class implants and biologics with advanced technologies like robotics, navigation, and AI, we are delivering personalized patient outcomes and supporting care teams globally. The winning combination of our core products, enabling technologies and unique intelligence is evident in our AiBLE™ ecosystem, where we’re changing the competitive dynamics in the market by delivering a complete experience that is being embraced by surgeons to improve patient care.
And in diabetes, we're creating a comprehensive portfolio of therapy options that redefines the experience for patients who need intensive insulin management. As the market shifts towards Automated Insulin Delivery and Smart Dosing, our strategy is driving growth and empowering patients. By enhancing our system and developing new technologies — like pumps, pens, patches, CGM, and algorithms — we're offering a range of options tailored to patients' unique needs. This isn’t just about managing diabetes; it’s about creating an experience that meets patients where they are and enables them to live a fuller life.
Reimagining partnerships as an industry leader The integration of devices and equipment — where all components are connected and communicative with feedback loops to improve procedures and therapies — is becoming apparent in some of our businesses today, and it will become the standard over time. This model leverages the network effect, where the value of a product or service increases as more people use it.
In today’s competitive landscape, Medtronic is uniquely positioned to thrive. With our robust balance sheet, expansive network, and established trust within the industry, we are equipped to lead and expand these integrated platforms, enhancing access and improving care. Non-traditional partnerships — with technology companies, software developers, even competitors are crucial to unlocking solutions that meaningfully meet demand at scale.

Consider our partnership with NVIDIA and Cosmo Pharmaceuticals, which has integrated NVIDIA’s healthcare and edge AI technologies into the GI Genius™ intelligent endoscopy module. This platform has been opened to third-party, start-up companies, who can develop, train, and validate their own AI applications and then distribute them on GI Genius™. These start-ups gain access to our global customer base, and they leverage the connectivity that we’ve established within the health system.
As we move to the future, Medtronic’s established success and commitment to innovation position us to drive creative partnerships that collectively advance integrated healthcare solutions.
Paving the way with new products, infrastructure improvements, and durable growth Medtronic has pioneered the MedTech industry for the last 75 years and we’re uniquely positioned to do it again. It’s in our DNA. In fact, in FY24, we achieved significant innovation across our four portfolios, with ~130 product approvals and early milestones in key markets. We’re primed for growth in attractive markets, including atrial fibrillation, structural heart, robotics, neuromodulation, hypertension, and diabetes.
Our advancements across product development, manufacturing, technology, and operations have positioned us for sustained revenue growth. We reported $32.4 billion in FY24 revenue, with 5.2% organic revenue growth, non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.20, and free cash flow of $5.2 billion that increased 14%. We boosted our investment in R&D, and we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, maintaining our commitment to return at least 50% of free cash flow. This year marks our 47th consecutive dividend increase, with 30% growth over the past 5 years and 130% over the past decade. Building on these results, we are confident in our ability to channel our significant strengths to deliver for customers, patients, and shareholders.
Building on our legacy to revolutionize healthcare for the future As we push the boundaries of what’s possible, our focus remains unwavering: to contribute to human welfare through the application of medical technology. As the world’s healthcare technology leader, every innovation we create enables better outcomes for patients, while also bringing us closer to a future where high-quality healthcare is accessible to all, not just a privileged few. The possibilities ahead are boundless, and I am thrilled by the potential that awaits us. Medtronic is not just adapting; we are leading the charge into a bold new era. As we deliver on this promise, we will create significant value for our shareholders, and amplify our impact on society.
Steadfast as ever, our enduring Mission — to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life — guides us into our 76th year and well into the future. Together, we are pioneering the future, where our technologies will continue to revolutionize healthcare and improve lives everywhere.
Sincerely,
Geoff Martha
Chairman & CEO

HUMAN CAPITAL
Medtronic Workforce Overview
Medtronic’s employees deliver on our Mission every day. We empower insight-driven care, experiences that put people first, and better outcomes for our world. In everything we do, we are engineering the extraordinary. We strive to be the employer of choice for the best and brightest global talent, where employees can grow and develop fulfilling careers. We aspire to create an inclusive, diverse, and equitable workplace that fosters innovation and creativity, and where employees feel a sense of belonging and well-being. Medtronic has 95,000+ full-time employees, of which 44% are based in the U.S. or Puerto Rico.
Inclusion, Diversity & Equity We believe that improving health for people from all walks of life depends on our ability to unleash the creative power of our diverse global employees. By breaking down barriers to Inclusion, Diversity and Equity (ID&E), we open doors for everyone, driving progress and prosperity around the world. We integrate ID&E principles throughout our Company to ensure every operating unit, team, and leader recognizes and celebrates the value of diverse experiences and backgrounds. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, 41% of our U.S. workforce is ethnically diverse; women comprise 51% of our global workforce; 44% of our manager and above employees are women; and 28% of our U.S. managers are ethnically diverse. Additionally, Medtronic employee resource groups (ERGs) are employee-led affinity groups that provide career development and networking opportunities for members and strengthen ties between employees of many different backgrounds, cultures, and interests. In fiscal year 2024, there were 13 ERGs and Diversity Networks across 300+ hubs or chapters in over 65 countries with more than 35,000 employees involved.
Pay Equity
In our most recent reported period available, in the United States, we have achieved 100% pay equity for gender and ethnically diverse employees. Globally we have achieved 99% pay equity for gender. We are actively working to resolve any remaining pay inequities by continuing to expand the annual pay equity analyses for each country we operate in.
Workforce Compensation
Our compensation framework is designed to celebrate the value and contributions of our employees. We are committed to transparent communications on compensation. Our competitive approach to compensation reflects industry benchmarks and local market standards. Our

programs include annual and long-term equity-based incentives that provide the means to share in the Company’s success, based on business and individual performance. To attract and retain the best leaders, we offer competitive benefits and cash and equity incentives. We reward high-performing employees with an ownership stake in the Company through restricted stock, and employees have the opportunity to purchase stock at a significant discount through our Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
Learning & Development The skills and dedication of our employees drive our business performance. Our comprehensive professional development programs empower our people to build rewarding careers and help us attract world-class talent from global and diverse populations. Our suite of professional development programs ensures that our employees, regardless of level, location, language or learning preferences, have access to opportunities to develop and grow.
In recent years, we have shifted away from degree requirements to focus on skills-based certification for certain roles within Medtronic.
Additionally, as members of the Multiple Pathways Initiative, we have used a skills-based approach to offering opportunities to expanded pools of external talent that have previously been held back due to lack of access to undergraduate education. Internally, eligible U.S. and Puerto Rico employees can now participate through MAPS (Medtronic Advancement Pathways and Skill-building) in undergraduate courses from top-tier universities to enhance or obtain new skills, at no cost to the employee. Our change in approach has opened opportunities for employees who have been otherwise restricted from career advancement due to degree requirements.
Employee Engagement and Culture Through our Organizational Health Survey, we gain valuable insight into the Medtronic employee experience and identify where we can improve in key priority areas: 1) Employee Engagement, 2) Inclusion, 3) Innovation, 4) Ethics and 5) Quality culture as part of our commitment to Put Patients First in our everyday decisions and actions. In our most recent survey ending in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, more than 87% of our employees responded. Medtronic carefully reviews and implements actions based on employee feedback in order to partner and create an inclusive, innovative and supportive environment.
Our culture, how we show up and get things done, is critical to achieving our vision. The Medtronic Mindset builds on our core values of integrity, quality, inclusion, and collaboration. It urges us to act boldly, compete to win, move with speed and decisiveness, foster belonging, and deliver results… the right way. Our culture helps us meet the needs of our patients and customers, and ensures our Mission endures for many years to come.
Health & Safety As a large, global employer, our ability to attract and retain talent is based in part on our commitment to maintain a safe workplace and support the well-being of our employees. Medtronic has a comprehensive approach to providing robust support for our employees and their families in natural disasters, public health crises, civil unrest and armed conflicts, bereavement, and other challenging events. Along with other programs, the Medtronic Employee Assistance Program and the Medtronic Employee Emergency Assistance Fund have historically supported employees and their families when faced with difficult times by providing a variety of services such as mental health, safety, and financial resources and support at no cost. These programs have proven invaluable in navigating our employees through unique challenges, including in fiscal year 2024. The Medtronic Employee Emergency Assistance Fund is supported by donations from employees and the Medtronic Foundation, and over the last five years has provided $4 million in grants to employees experiencing unexpected events creating a financial hardship.

OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR OPERATIONS
Research and Development The markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances and innovations. Constant improvement of existing products and introduction of new products is necessary to maintain market leadership. Our research and development (R&D) efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in the markets we serve to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new indications for existing products, and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs.
That commitment leads to our initiation and participation in hundreds of clinical trials each fiscal year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. Furthermore, our development activities are intended to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. We have not engaged in significant customer or government-sponsored research.
Our R&D activities include improving existing products and therapies, expanding their indications and applications for use, developing new therapies and procedures, and entering into arrangements with third parties to fund the development of certain technologies. We continue to focus on optimizing innovation, improving our R&D productivity, driving growth in emerging markets, generating clinical evidence, and

assessing our R&D programs based on their ability to address unmet clinical needs, produce better patient outcomes, and create new standards of care.
Intellectual Property and Litigation We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and agreements, including non-disclosure agreements, to protect our business and proprietary technology. In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses relating to a wide array of third-party technologies. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.
We operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Intellectual property litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time.
Sales and Distribution We sell our medical devices and therapies through a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors globally.
Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals. Our medical supply products are used primarily in hospitals, surgical centers, and alternate care facilities, such as home care and long-term care facilities, and are marketed to materials managers, group purchasing organizations (GPOs) and integrated delivery networks (IDNs). We often negotiate with GPOs and IDNs, which enter into supply contracts for the benefit of their member facilities. Our four largest markets are the U.S., Western Europe, China, and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity, as we believe they remain under- penetrated.
Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide. To achieve this objective, our marketing and sales teams are organized around physician specialties. This focus enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives who are able to foster strong relationships with physicians and other customers and enhance our ability to cross-sell complementary products.
We are not dependent on any single customer for more than 10 percent of our total net sales.
Competition, Industry, and Cost Containment We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances, innovations and scientific discoveries. Our product lines face a mix of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products.
In addition, we face competition from providers of other medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies, including those producing glucagon-like peptide-1s (GLP-1s).
Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product corrective actions, physician advisories, safety alerts, results of clinical trials to support superiority claims, and publications about our products, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry. In the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, declining reimbursement rates, and national and provincial tender pricing, competitively priced product offerings are essential to our business. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these products.
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These initiatives put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private healthcare insurance, managed-care plans, and volume-based procurement tenders in China, have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms. Hospitals, which purchase our technology, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, centralized purchasing, and in some cases, limiting the number of vendors that may participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from changes in practice patterns such as device standardization. This has created an increased level of price sensitivity among customers for our products.

Production and Availability of Raw Materials We manufacture products at manufacturing facilities located in various countries throughout the world. We purchase many of the components and raw materials used in manufacturing our products from numerous suppliers in various countries. Certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers and have plans and measures in place to help ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. Generally, we have been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials and components. However, due to the U.S. FDA’s manufacturing requirements and those of other regulatory authorities, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials if we experience a sudden or unexpected reduction or interruption in supply and are unable to develop alternative sources.
For additional information related to our manufacturing facilities refer to “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
Our operations and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government agencies, including the U.S. FDA, European regulatory authorities such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the United Kingdom, the Health Products Regulatory Authority in the Republic of Ireland and the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices in Germany, the China National Medical Product Administration (NMPA), and other government agencies inside and outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, distribution, and post-marketing surveillance of our products. Our business is also affected by patient and data privacy laws and government payor cost containment initiatives, as well as environmental health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, as a result of the release and availability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, including generative AI platforms, we have seen a global trend toward more comprehensive and refined regulation of AI that will impact our business, such as the White House's Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence and the EU AI Act, that are designed to ensure the ethical use, security, and privacy of AI and create standards for transparency, accountability, and fairness.
Product Approval and Monitoring In many countries where we do business, including the U.S., E.U. countries, Japan, and China, our products are subjected to approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety, and quality. For instance, authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally obtained in one of two primary ways. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k)
process, requires us to demonstrate that our medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second, more rigorous process, known as pre-market approval, requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. This process is generally much more time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process.
In the E.U., conformity with the marketing authorization requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety, and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. The competent authorities of the E.U. countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market. The Medical Device Regulation was published by the E.U. in 2017, and it imposes significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements (EU MDR). The regulation provided an implementation period and became effective on May 26, 2021. The European Commission recently extended the implementation period to the end of 2027 for high-risk devices and to the end of 2028 for medium and low risk devices.
The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products.
Regulations of the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing processes, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed products. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition, the U.S. FDA and other regulatory bodies, both in and outside the U.S. (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and various state Attorneys General), monitor the promotion and advertising of our products. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future pre-market approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" under, "We are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations."

Trade Regulations
The movement of products, services, technology, know-how, and investment across borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import, export and other international trade activities. We are subject to the risk that these laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs and burdens, as well as penalties if not complied with. Some governments impose economic sanctions and other trade restrictions against certain countries, persons or entities. We also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may in turn sell or provide such items to customers and other end-users in their own countries or by means of their own cross-border transactions. If we, or the third parties through which we do business, are not in compliance with applicable import, export control or economic sanctions laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action, and varying degrees of liability. Such actions may disrupt or delay sales of our products or services or result in restrictions on our distribution and sales of products or services that may materially impact our business.
Anti-Boycott Laws
Under U.S. laws and regulations, U.S. companies and their subsidiaries and affiliates outside the U.S. are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycotts in connection with certain business activities, including the sale, purchase, transfer, shipping or financing of goods or services within the U.S. or between the U.S. and countries outside of the U.S. If we, or certain third parties through which we sell or provide goods or services, violate anti-boycott laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degrees of liability.
Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations As a business with a significant global footprint, compliance with evolving regulations and standards in data privacy and cybersecurity has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased costs, new compliance challenges, and the threat of increased regulatory enforcement activity. Our business relies on the secure electronic transmission, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including personal information, protected health information, financial information, intellectual property and other sensitive information related to our products and therapies, customers, patients, and workforce.
Our global operational footprint comes with the obligation for compliance and adherence to individual data security, confidentiality and breach notification laws at the State Level, Federal Level, and International Level. Examples of those laws include, in the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and various State privacy laws that have become effective recently. We are also subject to various other country-specific requirements around the world, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom’s version of the same, and China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL).
Because the laws and regulations continue to expand, differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and are subject to evolving (and at times inconsistent) governmental interpretation, compliance with these laws and regulations may require significant additional cost expenditures or changes in products or business that increase competition or reduce revenue. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities, withdrawal of noncompliant products from a market, and reputational harm.
Regulations Governing Reimbursement
The delivery of our devices is subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of healthcare items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with federally funded healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of healthcare. Other governments also impose regulations in connection with their healthcare reimbursement programs and the delivery of healthcare items and services.
U.S. federal healthcare laws apply when we or customers submit claims for items or services that are reimbursed under federally-funded healthcare programs, including laws related to kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals or other healthcare fraud. There are often similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and anti-self-referral and insurance laws that apply to state Medicaid and other healthcare programs and private third-party payors. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S.-licensed physicians or U.S. teaching hospitals. Similarly, other jurisdictions impose transparency reporting obligations relating to health care professional payments. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.
Implementation of legislative or regulatory reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.

Environmental Health and Safety Laws We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations both within and outside the U.S. Like other companies in our industry, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the use, storage, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials.

Item 1A. Risk Factors Investing in our securities involves a variety of risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including, among others, those discussed below. Each of the following risks should be carefully considered, together with all the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and in our other filings with the SEC. Furthermore, additional risks and uncertainty not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flow and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties.
Business and Operational Risks We operate in a highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively.
We compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical markets in more than 150 countries throughout the world. These markets are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances, innovations and scientific discoveries. In the product lines in which we compete, we face a range of competitors from large companies with multiple business lines to small, specialized manufacturers that offer a limited selection of niche products. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes, technologies, or the introduction of reprocessed products or generic versions when our proprietary products lose their patent protection may make our existing or planned products less competitive. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies, including those producing GLP-1s.
We believe our ability to compete depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
• product performance and reliability, • product technology and innovation, • product quality and safety, • breadth of product lines, • product support services, • supplier and supply availability and performance, • customer support, • cost-effectiveness and price, • reimbursement approval from healthcare insurance providers, and • changes to the regulatory environment.

Competition may increase as additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. In addition, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring necessary product technologies. From time to time we have lost, and may in the future lose, market share in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts and publications about our products, which highlights the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems to our business. In the current environment of managed care, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition, declining reimbursement rates, and national and provincial tender pricing, as recently experienced in China, competitively priced product offerings are essential to our success.
Our success depends on our ability to differentiate our product and keep pace with emerging technologies.
Our continued growth and success depend on our ability to develop, acquire and market new and differentiated products, technologies and intellectual property, and as a result we also face competition for marketing, distribution, and collaborative development agreements, establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and licenses to intellectual property. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create, invest in or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into our proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, and manufacture and successfully market our products. For example, data science, machine learning and AI are all impacting our products and operations and the competitive landscape in which we operate, and the application of these technologies is rapidly evolving at the same time as new laws and regulations of AI are being developed in jurisdictions around the world. Compliance with developing regulations may require significant expenditures or may limit our ability to effectively use these technologies. There can be no assurance that the application of AI in our products and operations will be successful, or that we will not experience data security and privacy incidents in connection with our use of these technologies. Given these factors, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success.
Reduction or interruption in supply or other manufacturing difficulties may adversely affect our manufacturing operations and related product sales.
The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of a sufficient amount of quality components and materials and is highly exacting and complex, due in part to complex trade and strict regulatory requirements. We manufacture the majority of our products and procure critical third-party services, such as sterilization services, at numerous facilities worldwide. We purchase many of the components, raw materials and services needed to manufacture these products from numerous suppliers in various countries. We seek to maintain continuity of supply by use of multiple options for sourcing where possible. We have generally been able to obtain adequate supplies of such raw materials, components and services, although global shortages of certain components such as semiconductors and resins have recently caused, and may in the future cause, disruptions to our product manufacturing supply chain. In addition, for reasons of quality assurance, cost effectiveness, or availability, certain components, raw materials and services needed to manufacture our products are obtained from sole suppliers. Although we work closely with our suppliers to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, the supply of these components, raw materials and services may, at times, be interrupted or insufficient. In addition, due to the stringent regulations and requirements of trade and regulatory agencies, including the U.S. FDA, regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources. Additionally, many regulatory agencies are imposing new and evolving regulatory requirements on safe use of chemicals, including ethylene oxides (EtOs) and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and their potential impact on health and the environment which also may impact supply constraints. Furthermore, the prices of commodities and other materials used in our products, which are often volatile and outside of our control, could adversely impact our supply. We use resins, other petroleum-based materials and pulp as raw materials in some of our products, and the prices of oil and gas also significantly affect our costs for freight and utilities. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner and could result in lost sales.
Other disruptions in the manufacturing process or product sales, trade and fulfillment systems for any reason, including infrastructure, information and equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, supplier or Company facility shut-downs, defective raw materials, labor shortages, natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, or wildfires, property damage or facility closures from riots or public protests, and other environmental factors and the impact of epidemics, pandemics, or other public health crises, and actions by businesses, communities and governments in response, could lead to launch delays, product shortages, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. For example, in the past we have experienced a global information technology systems interruption that affected our customer ordering, distribution, and manufacturing processes, and we were adversely impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, and may in the future be adversely impacted by COVID-19 resurgence or other pandemics and the related responses of governments and of our partners, including suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and other businesses.
Furthermore, any failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers could result in quality or safety issues.
In addition, many of our products require sterilization before sale and several of our key products are manufactured or sterilized at a particular facility, with constrained capacity and limited options for alternate sterilization facilities. If an event occurs that causes damage to

or closure of one or more of such facilities, such as the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency's decision to close a supplier's sterilization facility in February 2019, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize relevant products to the required quality specifications or at all. Due to the time required to approve and license a manufacturing or sterilization facility, a third-party may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing or sterilization capacity is reduced or lost.
Public health crises have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on certain aspects of our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The nature and extent of future impacts are highly uncertain and unpredictable.
Our global operations and interactions with healthcare systems, providers and patients around the world expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. Public health crises may continue to have an adverse impact on certain aspects of our Company and business, including the demand for and supply of certain of our products, operations, supply chains and distribution systems, and our ability to generate cash flow.
Our research and development efforts rely upon investments and investment collaborations, and we cannot guarantee that any previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful.
Our Mission is to provide a broad range of therapies to restore patients to fuller, healthier lives, which requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through our research and development efforts, historically we have relied, and expect to continue to rely, upon investments and investment collaborations to provide us access to new technologies both in areas served by our existing businesses as well as in new areas.
We expect to make future investments where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technologies and products to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses. Investments and investment collaborations in and with medical technology companies are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any of our previous or future investments or investment collaborations will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
The continuing development of many of our products depends upon us maintaining strong relationships with healthcare professionals.
If we fail to maintain our working relationships with healthcare professionals, many of our products may not be developed and marketed in line with the needs and expectations of the professionals who use and support our products, which could cause a decline in our earnings and profitability. The research, development, marketing and sales of many of our new and improved products depends on our maintaining working relationships with healthcare professionals. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Healthcare professionals assist us as researchers, marketing and product consultants, inventors, trainers, and public speakers. If we are unable to maintain strong relationships with these professionals, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
We have debt obligations that create risk.
We are required to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion of our business. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future to supplement our existing liquidity and cash generated from operations to satisfy our needs for working capital and capital expenditures, to pursue growth initiatives, and to make returns of capital to shareholders. Changes in business and economic conditions will impact interest rates and can cause periods of tightened credit availability and volatility in borrowing terms. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit rating. At the time we may incur such additional indebtedness, or refinance or restructure existing indebtedness, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing with similar terms and currency denomination to our existing indebtedness, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. At any time, the fair value of our debt outstanding will fluctuate based on several factors including foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate movements, credit conditions and our credit rating.
Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully, or challenges related to the Company's strategic initiatives, including divestitures and third-party funding arrangements, as well as liabilities or claims relating to such acquired businesses, divestitures, or arrangements could adversely affect our business.
As part of our strategy to develop and identify new products and technologies and optimize our portfolio of products, we have made several significant acquisitions, divestitures and third-party research and development funding arrangements in recent years, and may make additional acquisitions, divestitures and arrangements in the future. Our integration of the operations of acquired businesses, or a divestiture of part of our existing businesses, requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve

significant amounts of management’s time that cannot then be dedicated to other projects. Our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of acquired companies successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business. Further, acquired businesses may have liabilities, or be subject to claims, litigation or investigations that we did not anticipate or which exceed our estimates at the time of the acquisition. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so. Factors that will affect the success of our acquisitions include:
• the presence or absence of adequate internal controls and/or significant fraud in the financial systems of acquired companies, • our ability or inability to integrate information technology systems of acquired companies in a secure and reliable manner, • liabilities, claims, litigation, investigations, or other adverse developments relating to acquired businesses or the business practices of acquired companies, including investigations by governmental entities, potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) or product liability claims, intellectual property disputes, earnout or other contingent payment disputes, or other unanticipated liabilities, • any decrease in customer loyalty and product orders caused by dissatisfaction with the combined companies’ product lines and sales and marketing practices, including price increases, • our ability to retain key employees, and • the ability to achieve synergies among acquired companies, such as increasing sales of the integrated company’s products, achieving cost savings, and effectively combining technologies to develop new products.
We also could experience negative effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows from acquisition-related charges, amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges.
In addition, the potential exists that expected strategic benefits from any planned or completed divestiture, or third-party funding arrangement, by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, and there can be no assurance that disputes will not arise under the Company's third-party funding arrangements, or transition service agreements that have or may be executed as part of a divestiture.
Legal and Regulatory Risks We are subject to extensive and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
Our medical devices and technologies, as well as our business activities, are subject to a complex set of regulations and rigorous enforcement, including by the U.S. FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, and numerous other federal, state, and non-U.S. governmental authorities. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our products. As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations, and trial endpoints. Unfavorable clinical data from existing or future clinical trials may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate, and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products, and the failure to maintain approvals or obtain approval or clearance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Even if we are able to obtain approval or clearance, it may:
• take a significant amount of time, • require the expenditure of substantial resources, • involve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance, • involve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products, and • limit the proposed uses of our products.
Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under the U.S. FDA and other applicable non- U.S. government agency regulations. For instance, many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections by the U.S. FDA to assess compliance with applicable regulations. The results of these inspections can include, and have in the past included, inspectional observations on the U.S. FDA’s Form 483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement, such as a consent decree. If the U.S. FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical products are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of non-U.S. governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, and in certain rare circumstances, ban medical devices. The U.S. FDA and other non-U.S. government agencies may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating

restrictions on a company-wide basis. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations.
Furthermore, we occasionally receive subpoenas or other requests for information from various governmental agencies around the world, and while these investigations typically relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices, we cannot predict the timing, outcome or impact of any such investigations. Any adverse outcome in one or more of these investigations could include the commencement of civil and/or criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties, and/or administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs and/or entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional, costly compliance obligations. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from government investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
In addition, the U.S. FDA has taken the position that device manufacturers are prohibited from promoting their products other than for the uses and indications set forth in the approved product labeling, and any failure to comply could subject us to significant civil or criminal exposure, administrative obligations and costs, and/or other potential penalties from, and/or agreements with, the federal government.
Governmental regulations in the U.S. and outside the U.S. are constantly changing and may become increasingly stringent. In the E.U, for example, the Medical Device Regulation which became effective in May 2021 includes significant additional pre-market and post-market requirements. Penalties for regulatory non-compliance could be severe, including fines and revocation or suspension of a company’s business license, mandatory price reductions and criminal sanctions. The development and implementation of future laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on us.
Quality problems have in the past and could in the future lead to recalls or safety alerts, product liability claims, reputational harm, adverse verdicts or costly settlements, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the impact on patients, and the serious and potentially costly consequences of adverse product performance. Our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, and marketing of medical devices. In addition, many of our products are often used in intensive care settings with seriously ill patients and some of the medical devices we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely.
Component failures, manufacturing nonconformances, design issues, off-label use, or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information with respect to our products, could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient. These problems have in the past and could in the future lead to recall of, or issuance of a safety alert relating to, our products, as well as product liability claims and lawsuits, including class actions, which could ultimately result, in certain cases, in the removal from the body of such products and claims regarding costs associated therewith. Due to the strong name recognition of the Medtronic brand, a material adverse event involving one of our products could result in diminished market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand, and could harm our reputation and ability to market products in the future.
Strong product quality is critical to the success of our goods and services. If we fall short of these standards and our products are the subject of recalls or safety alerts, our reputation could be damaged, we could lose customers and our revenue and results of operations could decline. Our success also can depend on our ability to manufacture to exact specification precision-engineered components, subassemblies and finished devices from multiple materials. If our components fail to meet these standards or fail to adapt to evolving standards, our reputation, competitive advantage and market share could be harmed. In certain situations, we may undertake a voluntary recall of products or temporarily shut down production lines based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data.
Any of the foregoing problems, including future product liability claims or recalls, regardless of their ultimate outcome, could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Our failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement of healthcare goods and services may subject us to penalties and adversely impact our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Our devices, products and therapies are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental healthcare programs (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and comparable non-U.S. programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. As a result, our devices, products and therapies are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by HHS, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), as well as comparable state and non-U.S. agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care goods and services, including laws and regulations related to fair competition, kickbacks, false claims, self-referrals and healthcare fraud. Many states have similar laws that apply to reimbursement by state Medicaid and other funded programs as well as in some cases to all payors. In certain circumstances, insurance companies attempt to bring a private cause of action against a manufacturer for causing false claims. In addition, as a manufacturer of U.S. FDA-approved devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are

subject to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires us to annually report certain payments and other transfers of value we make to U.S. licensed physicians, certain allied health professionals, and U.S. teaching hospitals. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or our officers and employees to criminal and civil financial penalties.
We are also subject to risks relating to changes in government and private medical reimbursement programs and policies, and changes in legal regulatory requirements in the U.S. and around the world. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to these reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to coverage of or reimbursement for our products by administrators of these systems, could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.
We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impacting our ability to sell current or future products.
We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, and agreements (such as employee and non-disclosure) to protect our business and proprietary intellectual property. We also operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Intellectual property litigation can result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected products or require us to pay significant royalties in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected products. At any given time, we are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of intellectual property actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of intellectual property litigation, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require us to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or that enforcement actions to protect our patent and proprietary rights against others could be unsuccessful, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our stock price to decline.
While we intend to defend against any threats to our intellectual property, our patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets or agreements (such as employee, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements) may not adequately protect our intellectual property.
Further, pending patent applications may not result in patents being issued to us, patents issued to or licensed by us may be challenged or circumvented by competitors and such patents may be found invalid, unenforceable or too limited in scope to protect our technology or provide us with any competitive advantage. In addition, our patents will expire over time, our ability to protect novel business models is uncertain, and infringement may go undetected. Third parties could obtain patents that may require us to negotiate licenses to conduct our business, and such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. In addition, license agreements could be terminated. We also rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. We cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, that such provisions will be enforceable, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information, or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or proprietary knowledge. Moreover, in the U.S. the Federal Trade Commission and various states have adopted laws and regulations that purport to ban or severely restrict the use of non-competition agreements, which may limit our ability to use and enforce non-competition agreements with employees.
In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market or manufacture some of our products do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position. For example, business in China comprises approximately seven percent of our total revenues. This may increase our vulnerability to our technology being reverse engineered or our trade secrets being compromised. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in China or other countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that substantially mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights.
Healthcare policy changes may have a material adverse effect on us.
There have been and continue to be actions and proposals by several governments, regulators and third-party payors globally, including the U.S. federal and state governments and the government in China, to control healthcare costs and, more generally, to reform healthcare systems. Certain of these actions and proposals, among other things, limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, increase the importance of our ability to compete on cost, and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. These actions and proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

We rely on the proper function, security and availability of our information technology systems and data, as well as those of third parties throughout our global supply chain and our customer and payor base, to operate our business, and a breach, cyber-attack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position.
We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business. That technology includes systems that could be used to process, transmit and store sensitive data. Additionally, many of our products and services include integrated software and information technology that collects data regarding patients or connects to other internal systems. One of the most prevalent attacks on large organizations has been ransomware which can have a devastating impact on an organization’s operations. Our ransomware readiness program has required and will continue to require investment and will not guarantee that we will be immune from an incident or be able to respond rapidly enough to prevent a negative impact on our business. Like all organizations, we routinely experience attempted interference with the integrity of, and interruptions in, our technology systems via events such as cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, or other breakdowns. The consequences could mean data breaches, interference with the integrity of our products and data, compromise of intellectual property or other proprietary information, or other significant disruptions. Furthermore, we rely on third-party vendors to supply and/or support certain aspects of our information technology systems and resulting products, and customers and payors use information technology systems to process payments relating to our products and services. These third-party systems could also become vulnerable to cyber-attack, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, interference, or other significant disruptions, and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. In addition, our global profile and international operations expose us to geopolitical events or issues which may increase cybersecurity risks on a global basis. Lastly, we continue to grow in part through new business acquisitions and, as a result, may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in acquired businesses’ systems, or difficulties or other breakdowns or disruptions in connection with the integration of the acquisitions into our information technology systems.
Our worldwide operations mean that we are subject to laws and regulations, including data protection and cybersecurity laws and regulations, in many jurisdictions. The variety of U.S. and international privacy and cybersecurity laws and regulations impacting our operations are described in “Item 1. Business" – Other Factors Impacting Our Operations – Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations. Any data security breaches, cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions or significant disruptions could result in actions by regulatory bodies and/or civil litigation, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation, or competitive position.
In addition, our information technology systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems. We experience continuing changes in information processing technology, legal and regulatory standards, patient and customer information use cases, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to data and information systems, and the information technology needs associated with our changing products and services. We also face business and regulatory risks relating to our use of AI systems in our business operations and products. These systems are susceptible to flaws, biases, malfunctions or manipulations, which may disrupt our operations, result in erroneous decision-making, elevate our cyber risk profile, or expose us to penalties from non-compliance with emerging regulations. There can be no assurance that our efforts to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technologies, including AI systems, and to deploy these technologies to our business operations and products will be successful or that additional systems issues will not arise in the future.
If our information technology systems, products or services or sensitive data are compromised, there are many consequences that could result. Consequences include, but are not limited to, patients or employees being exposed to financial or medical identity theft or suffering a loss of product functionality, losing existing customers or have difficulty attracting new customers, experiencing difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, being exposed to the loss or misuse of confidential information, having disputes with customers, physicians, and other healthcare professionals, suffering regulatory sanctions or penalties under federal laws, state laws, or the laws of other jurisdictions, experiencing increases in operating expenses or an impairment in our ability to conduct our operations, incurring expenses or losing revenues as a result of a data privacy breach, product failure, information technology outages or disruptions, or suffering other adverse consequences including lawsuits or other legal action and damage to our reputation.
The failure to comply with anti-corruption laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.
The U.S. FCPA, the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offences) Act 2018, and similar anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and to ensure adequate internal controls, books, and records. Because of the predominance of government-administered healthcare systems in many jurisdictions around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore potentially subject to such laws. We also participate in public-private partnerships and other commercial and policy arrangements with governments around the globe.
Global enforcement of anti-corruption laws has increased in recent years, including investigations and enforcement proceedings leading to assessment of significant fines and penalties against companies and individuals. Our international operations create a risk of unauthorized

payments or offers of payments by one of our employees, consultants, sales agents, or distributors. We maintain various controls aligned with legal requirements to prevent and prohibit improper practices, including policies, programs, and training for our employees and third party intermediaries acting on our behalf. However, existing safeguards and any future improvements may not always be effective, and our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. In addition, regulators could seek to hold us liable for conduct committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. Any alleged or actual violations of these regulations may subject us to government scrutiny, criminal or civil sanctions and other liabilities, including exclusion from government contracting, and could disrupt our business, adversely affect our reputation and result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Laws and regulations governing international business operations could adversely impact our business.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with, or making investments in, certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S.
economic sanctions or export restrictions. Our international operations subject us to these laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries, governments, entities, and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations.
From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions, including Iran, Syria, Cuba, and the region of Crimea, as well as Russia and Belarus. Certain of our subsidiaries sell medical devices, and may provide related services, to distributors and other purchasing bodies in such countries or regions. These business dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income, but expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. Violations of these regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, such regulations may impact our ability to continue operations in certain countries and require additional licenses which we may not be able to obtain or maintain. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.
Climate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere presents risks to our current and future operations. We face current and long-term operational risks and have in the past experienced business interruptions from severe weather events and other natural conditions, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, extreme temperatures, wildfires or flooding. Such severe weather events caused by or related to climate change or other conditions caused by natural disasters have in the past and could in the future increase our operational costs, pose physical risks to our facilities and adversely impact our supply chain, including:
manufacturing and distribution networks, the availability and cost of raw materials and components, energy supply, transportation, or other inputs necessary for the operation of our business. The impacts of climate change on global water resources may result in water scarcity, which could impact our ability to access sufficient quantities of water in certain locations and result in increased costs. Although it is difficult to predict and adequately prepare to meet the challenges to our business posed by climate change, concerns over climate change also could result in new laws or regulations that are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, and we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations as well as adverse impacts on raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products.
We are subject to environmental laws and regulations and the risk of environmental liabilities, violations and litigation.
We are subject to environmental, health, and safety laws, and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances or wastes, the remediation of hazardous substances or materials at various sites, and emissions or discharges into the land, air or water. We are further subject to numerous laws and regulations concerning, among other things, chemical constituents in medical products and end-of-life disposal and take-back programs for medical devices. Our operations and those of certain third-party suppliers involve the use of substances subject to these laws and regulations, primarily those used in manufacturing and sterilization processes. If we or our suppliers violate these environmental laws and regulations, facilities could be shut down and violators could be fined, or otherwise sanctioned. New laws and regulations, violations of these laws or regulations, stricter enforcement of existing requirements, or the discovery of previously unknown contamination could require us to incur costs or could become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could be material.
We are subject to risks related to our environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and initiatives.
There is continued focus from our stakeholders, as well as regulatory authorities in the U.S., E.U. and other global jurisdictions in which we operate, on ESG practices and disclosure. If we do not succeed in meeting or are perceived as not meeting, stated goals and objectives, in any number of ESG matters, such as environmental stewardship, ID&E initiatives, supply chain practices, good corporate governance,

workplace conduct and support for local communities, or if we do not effectively respond to new or revised legal, regulatory or reporting requirements concerning climate change or other sustainability concerns, we may be subject to regulatory fines and penalties, our reputation or the reputation of our brands may suffer, we may be unable to attract and retain top talent, and our stock price may be negatively affected.
In addition, enhanced and sometimes conflicting ESG laws, regulations and expectations in the jurisdictions in which we do business may increase compliance burdens and costs for third parties throughout our global supply chain, which could cause disruption in the sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Further, we have made several public disclosures of objectives and targets (targets) relating to product stewardship, ID&E, patient safety and product quality, access and innovation, and climate stewardship, including our ambition to be carbon neutral in our operations by 2030 and to achieve net zero emissions by 2045. Although we intend to achieve these targets, we may be required to expend significant resources to do so, which could increase our operational costs. In addition, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our targets will be achieved, or that any future investments we make to achieve such targets will meet investor, legal and/or any other regulatory expectations and requirements. If we are unable to meet our targets, we may face litigation and could incur regulatory fines and penalties or adverse publicity and reaction from investors, advocacy groups or other stakeholders that may adversely impact our business, demand for our products and services, and/or our financial condition and results of operations.
Our insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses.
We have elected to self-insure most of our insurable risks across the Company, and we made this decision based on cost and availability factors in the insurance marketplace. We manage and maintain a portion of our self-insured program through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. We continue to maintain a directors and officers liability insurance policy with third-party insurers that provides coverage for the directors and officers of the Company. We continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value of obtaining insurance coverage for other categories of losses in the future. Although we believe, based on historical loss trends, that our self-insurance program accruals and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future losses, historical trends may not be indicative of future losses. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for other categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and these losses could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15% in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for Medtronic in fiscal year 2025. We continue to evaluate the impacts of the enacted Pillar Two legislation.
The tax laws, inclusive of Pillar Two legislation, in the U.S., Ireland and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
We are subject to ongoing tax audits in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
We have recorded reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions. However, the calculation of such tax liabilities involves the application of complex tax laws, regulations and treaties (where applicable) in many jurisdictions. Therefore, any dispute with a tax authority may result in a payment that is significantly different from current estimates. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities generally would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the amount for which it is ultimately liable, we would incur additional charges, and such charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
The outcome of Medtronic, Inc.'s U.S. tax litigation could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.
In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report for Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreements with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of our key manufacturing sites. The Tax Court issued its opinion in August 2022, the IRS filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in September 2023, and Medtronic subsequently filed a cross-appeal in October 2023. An adverse outcome in this matter could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Future potential changes to the U.S. tax laws could result in us being treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes, and the IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Because Medtronic plc is organized under the laws of Ireland, we would generally be classified as a foreign corporation under the general rule that a corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Even so, the IRS may assert that we should be treated as a U.S. corporation (and, therefore, a U.S. tax resident) for U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In addition, a retroactive change to U.S. tax laws in this area could change this classification. If we were to be treated as a U.S. corporation for federal tax purposes, we could be subject to substantially greater U.S. tax liability than currently contemplated as a non-U.S. corporation.
Legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of U.S. federal or state governmental contracts to U.S. companies that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business.
Various U.S. federal and state legislative proposals that would deny governmental contracts to U.S. companies that move their corporate location abroad may affect us. We are unable to predict the likelihood that, or final form in which, any such proposed legislation might become law, the nature of the regulations that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactments, or the effect such enactments and increased regulatory scrutiny may have on our business.
Risks Relating to Our Jurisdiction of Incorporation We are incorporated in Ireland, and Irish law differs from the laws in effect in the U.S. and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.
Our shareholders may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. It may not be possible to enforce court judgments obtained in the U.S. against us in Ireland based on the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws. In addition, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on the civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws. We have been advised that the U.S.
currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. Therefore, a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not based solely on U.S. federal or state securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Ireland.
As an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act 2014, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only.
Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in the U.S.
As an Irish public limited company, certain capital structure decisions require shareholder approval, which may limit Medtronic’s flexibility to manage its capital structure.
Under Irish law, our authorized share capital can be increased by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders and the directors may issue new ordinary or preferred shares, without shareholder approval, once authorized to do so by our articles of association or by an ordinary resolution of our shareholders. Additionally, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory preemption rights to existing shareholders where shares are being issued for cash consideration but allows shareholders to disapply such statutory preemption rights either in our articles of association or by way of special resolution. Such disapplication can either be generally applicable or be in respect of a particular allotment of shares. Accordingly, at our 2023 Annual General Meeting, our Shareholders authorized our Board of Directors to issue up to 20% of our issued ordinary shares and further authorized our Board of Directors to issue such shares for cash without first offering them to our existing shareholders. Both of these authorizations will expire on April 19, 2025, unless renewed by shareholders for a further period. We anticipate seeking new authorizations at our 2024 Annual General Meeting and in subsequent years. We cannot provide any assurance that these authorizations will always be approved, which could limit our ability to issue equity and thereby adversely affect the holders of our securities.
A transfer of our shares, other than ones effected by means of the transfer of book-entry interests in the Depository Trust Company, may be subject to Irish stamp duty.
Transfers of our shares effected by means of the transfer of book entry interests in the Depository Trust Company (DTC) will not be subject to Irish stamp duty. However, if a shareholder holds our shares directly rather than beneficially through DTC, any transfer of shares could be subject to Irish stamp duty (currently at the rate of 1% of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the shares acquired).
Payment of Irish stamp duty is generally a legal obligation of the transferee. The potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of shares.

In certain limited circumstances, dividends we pay may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax and dividends received by Irish residents and certain other shareholders may be subject to Irish income tax.
In certain limited circumstances, dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 25%) may arise in respect of dividends paid on our shares.
A number of exemptions from dividend withholding tax exist such that shareholders resident in the U.S. and other specified countries that have a tax treaty with Ireland may be entitled to exemptions from dividend withholding tax.
Shareholders resident in the U.S. that hold their shares through DTC will not be subject to dividend withholding tax, provided the addresses of the beneficial owners of such shares in the records of the brokers holding such shares are recorded as being in the U.S. (and such brokers have further transmitted the relevant information to a qualifying intermediary appointed by us). However, other shareholders may be subject to dividend withholding tax, which could adversely affect the price of their shares.
Shareholders entitled to an exemption from Irish dividend withholding tax on dividends received from us will not be subject to Irish income tax in respect of those dividends unless they have some connection with Ireland other than their shareholding in our Company (for example, they are resident in Ireland). Shareholders who are not resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland, but who receive dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax, will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on those dividends.
Our shares received by means of a gift or inheritance could be subject to Irish capital acquisitions tax.
Irish capital acquisitions tax (CAT) could apply to a gift or inheritance of our shares irrespective of the place of residence, ordinary residence or domicile of the parties. This is because our shares will be regarded as property situated in Ireland. The person who receives the gift or inheritance has primary liability for CAT. Gifts and inheritances passing between spouses are exempt from CAT. Children currently have a tax-free threshold of €335,000 in respect of taxable gifts or inheritances received from their parents.
Economic and Industry Risks Changes in the prices of our goods and services, customer purchasing patterns and stocking dynamics, and/or inflationary costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
We have had, and may continue to have, periods when prices for certain of our goods and services decrease due to pricing pressure from managed care organizations and other third-party payors on our customers; increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates; periodic variation in timing, volume, and pricing associated with customer purchasing patterns and stocking dynamics; and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing services providers. We have also recently experienced, and may continue to experience, rising costs due to inflation. If the prices for our goods and services change for any reason or inflation continues to rise, we may be unable to sufficiently reduce our expenses or offset rising costs through increased prices to customers. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows may be adversely affected.
We are subject to a variety of risks associated with global operations that could adversely affect our profitability and operating results.
We develop, manufacture, distribute and sell our products globally. We intend to continue to expand our operations and to pursue growth opportunities outside the U.S., especially in emerging markets. Operations in different countries including emerging markets could expose us to additional and greater risks and potential costs, including:
• fluctuations in currency exchange rates, • healthcare reform legislation, • the need to comply with different regulatory regimes worldwide that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products, • local product preferences and product requirements, • longer-term receivables than are typical in the U.S., • economic sanctions, export controls, trade protection measures, tariffs and other border taxes, and import or export licensing requirements, • less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the U.S. than exists in the U.S., • different labor regulations and workforce instability, • political and economic instability, including as a result of armed conflicts and insurrections, • restrictions on local currency conversion or cash extraction, • potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws, and • economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations.
The ongoing global economic competition and trade tensions between the U.S. and China present risk to Medtronic. Although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact on Medtronic from increased duties imposed by both sides (through petitioning both governments for

tariff exclusions and other mitigations), the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions. Tariff exclusions awarded to Medtronic by the U.S. Government require periodic renewal, and policies for granting exclusions could shift. The U.S. and China, which comprises approximately seven percent of our total revenues, could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions, which could affect Medtronic’s access to the markets.
The Russia-Ukraine conflict and resulting sanctions and export restrictions are creating barriers to doing business in Russia and Belarus and adversely impacting global supply chains. While we have no manufacturing, distribution or direct material suppliers in the region, we continue to closely monitor the potential raw material/sub-tier supplier impact in both Russia and Ukraine including materials like palladium and neon, which are both dependent on Russia supply. Additional sanctions, export restrictions, and potential countermeasures within Russia, along with geopolitical shifts in Asia and disruptions relating to Israel's conflict in Gaza, may lead to greater uncertainty that could cause additional adverse impacts on global supply chains and our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
More generally, several governments including the U.S. have raised the possibility of policies to induce “re-shoring” of supply chains, less reliance on imported supplies, and greater national production. Examples include potential “Buy America” requirements in the U.S. If such steps triggered retaliation in other markets restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their government-owned healthcare systems, the result could be a significant impact on Medtronic.
Other significant changes or disruptions to international trade arrangements, such as termination or modifications of other existing trade agreements, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, a significant amount of our trade receivables are with national healthcare systems in many countries. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the political and financial stability of those countries. In light of these global economic fluctuations, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Finally, changes in currency exchange rates may impact the reported value of our revenues, expenses, and cash flows. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company's operating results. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes.
Market disruptions resulting in diminished liquidity, or healthcare professional and staff strikes or other work stoppages, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operation, or financial condition.
Disruptions in international markets and supporting financial services and uncertainty about economic conditions (for instance, resulting from credit scarcity, geopolitical risks and sovereign debt deterioration), have in the past caused periods of tightened credit availability and increased volatility in liquidity and borrowing terms. If these conditions were to recur or worsen, we may experience reduced demand for a number of our products. We also could experience reduced sales and profits due to delayed payments or the insolvency of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers, suppliers and vendors who experience liquidity issues, including as a result of cybersecurity incidents impacting private and government health insurance payors. In addition, healthcare professional and staff strikes or other work stoppages have in the past and may in the future cause reduced demand for our products. As a result, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Consolidation in the healthcare industry and the growing prevalence of ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.
Many healthcare industry companies, including healthcare systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which can be used to negotiate price concessions. In addition, the movement of procedures to ASCs could also create downward pricing pressure. If we must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation or ASC procedures, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation or ASC procedures, our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows could be adversely affected.
Healthcare industry cost-containment measures could result in reduced sales of our medical devices and medical device components.
Most of our customers, and the healthcare providers to whom our customers supply medical devices, rely on third-party payors, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures in which medical devices that incorporate components we manufacture or assemble are used. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors. If third-party payor payment approval cannot be obtained by patients, sales of finished medical devices that include our components may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate purchases of our components. The cost-containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S., could harm our ability to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations have successfully negotiated volume discounts for pharmaceuticals, and GPOs and IDNs have also

concentrated purchasing decisions for some customers, which has led to downward pricing pressure for medical device companies, including us.
Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None.
Item 1C. Cybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy We have designed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program to help us identify, assess, and mitigate cybersecurity risks relevant to our business, based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cyber Security Framework 2.0.
Our cybersecurity risk management program includes:
• dedicated cybersecurity professionals who analyze cybersecurity threats, define cybersecurity policy and requirements, implement protections, and monitor and respond to cybersecurity incidents, • cybersecurity regulatory based risk assessments for the Company’s systems and applications (where required), • a formal incident response plan, in which incidents are classified based upon the severity, impact, and the potential harm that can be caused by the incident, • annual information security training program for all employees, including phishing awareness training, • cybersecurity works closely with application development and infrastructure & operation teams to embed security considerations into the foundation of technology, • engagement of third-party service providers to conduct assessment of the Company’s cybersecurity risk management program, penetration testing, and vulnerability testing, • a third-party risk assessment process for service providers, suppliers, and vendors.
In addition, given the smart technology within our devices, our product security includes design protocols and is supported by quality systems testing and use scanning tools to assess and detect vulnerabilities that could affect our products.
Risks from cybersecurity threats are integrated into Medtronic’s enterprise risk management (ERM) program. The ERM program establishes a risk management framework that seeks to identify, assess, and mitigate risks that could materially impact the Company’s business and operation.
To date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s business or operations. However, despite our security measures, there can be no assurance that the Company, or the third parties with which we interact, will not experience a cybersecurity incident in the future that may materially affect us. See Item 1A. Risk Factors under, “We rely on the proper function, security and availability of our information technology systems and data, as well as those of third parties throughout our global supply chain and our customer and payor base, to operate our business, and a breach, cyber-attack or other disruption to these systems or data could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation or competitive position.”
Governance The cybersecurity risk management program is led by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). Our CISO has over 28 years of experience assisting public and privately held companies in a variety of industries, leading several enterprise-wide transformation initiatives to adapt to changing cybersecurity threats. The CISO has held various executive level positions within Fortune 500 companies. Our CISO reports to the Chief Information Officer (CIO), who leads the Global Information Technology (IT) organization and works closely with the Executive Committee to guide strategic direction and IT decisions to drive business outcomes.
Our Board of Directors is engaged in the Company’s ERM program and receives briefings on the outcomes of the ERM program and the steps the Company takes to mitigate risks that the program identifies. The Quality Committee of the Board oversees the Company’s cybersecurity strategies, systems, and controls to ensure reliability and prevent unauthorized access. The Audit Committee discusses policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including risks associated with the reliability and security of the Company’s information technology and security systems, and the steps management has undertaken to monitor and control such exposures. The Audit Committee receives regular updates on the Company’s cybersecurity risk management program from the CISO and CIO.
Item 2. Properties Medtronic's principal executive office is located in Ireland and is leased by the Company, while its main operational offices are located in the Minneapolis, Minnesota metropolitan area and are owned by the Company.

The Company's total manufacturing and research space is approximately 9.9 million square feet. Approximately 36 percent of the manufacturing or research facilities are owned by Medtronic and the remaining balance is leased. The following is a summary of the Company's largest manufacturing facilities by location:
Location Country or State Square Feet (in thousands)
Connecticut 1,138 Puerto Rico 812 Mexico 762 China 708 Minnesota 568 Ireland 446 Dominican Republic 395 Arizona 294 Switzerland 283 California 258 Massachusetts 250 France 249 Italy 230 Colorado 228 Medtronic also maintains sales and administrative offices outside the U.S. at 114 locations in 62 countries. A majority of these locations are leased. The Company is using substantially all of its currently available productive space to develop, manufacture, and market its products.
The Company's facilities are well-maintained, suitable for their respective uses, and adequate for current needs.
Item 3. Legal Proceedings In accordance with Item 103 of Regulation S-K, we have adopted a $1 million disclosure threshold for proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, as we believe matters under this threshold are not material to the Company. A discussion of the Company’s legal proceedings and other loss contingencies are described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable.

Irish Restrictions on Import and Export of Capital Except as indicated below, there are no restrictions on non-residents of Ireland dealing in Irish domestic securities, which includes ordinary shares of Irish companies. Except as indicated below, dividends and redemption proceeds also continue to be freely transferable to non- resident holders of such securities. The Financial Transfers Act, 1992 provides that the Irish Minister for Finance can make provision for the restriction of financial transfers between Ireland and other countries. For the purposes of this Act, “financial transfers” include all transfers which would be movements of capital or payments within the meaning of the treaties governing the E.U. if they had been made between Member States of the E.U. To date, the Irish Minister for Finance has restricted financial transfers between Ireland and a number of third countries and the list is subject to on-going change.
Any transfer of, or payment in respect of, a share or interest in a share involving the government of any country that is currently the subject of United Nations or E.U. sanctions, any person or body controlled by any of the foregoing, or by any person acting on behalf of the foregoing, may be subject to restrictions pursuant to such sanctions as implemented into Irish law.
Irish Taxes Applicable to U.S. Holders Dividends paid by Medtronic will generally be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at a rate of 25 percent) unless an exemption applies.
Dividends paid to U.S. residents will not be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax provided that:
• in the case of a beneficial owner of Medtronic shares held in the Depository Trust Company (DTC), the address of the beneficial owner in the records of his or her broker is in the United States and this information is provided by the broker to the Company’s qualifying intermediary; or • in the case of a record owner, the record owner has provided to the Company’s transfer agent a valid U.S. Certification of Residence (Form 6166) or valid Irish Non-Resident Form V2.
Irish income tax may also arise with respect to dividends paid on Medtronic’s ordinary shares. A U.S. resident who meets one of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax described above and who does not hold Medtronic shares through a branch or agency in Ireland through which a trade is carried on generally will not have any Irish income tax liability on a dividend paid by Medtronic. In addition, if a U.S. shareholder is subject to the dividend withholding tax, the withholding payment discharges any Irish income tax liability, provided the shareholder furnishes to the Irish Revenue authorities a statement of the dividend withholding tax imposed.
While the U.S./Ireland Double Tax Treaty contains provisions regarding withholding, due to the wide scope of the exemptions from dividend withholding tax available under Irish domestic law, it would generally be unnecessary for a U.S. resident shareholder to rely on the treaty provisions.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
UNDERSTANDING OUR FINANCIAL INFORMATION
The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The discussion focuses on our financial results for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024 (fiscal year 2024) and the fiscal year ended April 28, 2023 (fiscal year 2023). A discussion on our results of operations for fiscal year 2023 as compared to the year ended April 29, 2022 (fiscal year 2022) is included in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 28, 2023, filed with the SEC on June 22, 2023, and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. You should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 and for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, which are presented within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Amounts reported in millions within this annual report are computed based on the amounts in thousands, and therefore, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.
Financial Trends
Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we present certain financial measures that facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning; however, such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP). These financial measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" and are intended to supplement, and should not be considered as superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company's underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry.
As presented in the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations section on the following pages, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of amortization of intangible assets and certain charges or benefits that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments).
In the event there is a Non-GAAP Adjustment recognized in our operating results, the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported. Because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the Non-GAAP Adjustments that take place during the period, we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non-GAAP nominal tax rate (Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate). The Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate is calculated as the income tax provision, adjusted for the impact of Non-GAAP Adjustments, as a percentage of income before income taxes, excluding Non-GAAP Adjustments.
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting property, plant, and equipment additions from operating cash flows.
Refer to the “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations," "Income Taxes," and "Free Cash Flow" sections for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

(2) The charges predominantly include $439 million of charges related to the February 20, 2024 decision to exit the Company's ventilator product line, which primarily includes long-lived intangible asset impairments and inventory write-downs. In addition, other charges primarily consist of changes in fair value of contingent consideration and associated costs related to the previously contemplated separation of the PMRI businesses.
(3) We exclude unrealized and realized gains and losses on our minority investments as we do not believe that these components of income or expense have a direct correlation to our ongoing or future business operations.
(4) The charges represent incremental costs of complying with the new European Union medical device regulations for previously registered products and primarily include charges for contractors supporting the project and other direct third-party expenses. We consider these costs to be duplicative of previously incurred costs and/or one-time costs, which are limited to a specific time period.
(5) The net charge primarily relates to an income tax reserve adjustment associated with the June 2023, Israeli Central-Lod District Court decision and the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain net operating losses which were partially offset by a benefit from the change in a Swiss Cantonal tax rate associated with previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions and the step up in tax basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes.
(6) The charges predominantly include non-cash pre-tax impairments, primarily related to goodwill, changes in the carrying value of the disposal group, and other associated costs, as a result of the April 2023 sale of half of the Company's Renal Care Solutions (RCS) business; business combination costs, and associated costs related to the previously contemplated separation of the PMRI businesses.
(7) Certain litigation includes $35 million income related to the one-time payment received as a result of the Intellectual Property Agreement entered into with Edwards Lifesciences in April 2023.
(8) The charges relate to the early redemption of approximately $2.3 billion of debt and were recorded within interest expense, net within the consolidated statements of income.
(9) The charge primarily relates to a $764 million reserve adjustment that was a direct result of the U.S. Tax Court opinion, issued in August 2022, on the previously disclosed litigation regarding the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico.
Additional charges relate to the reduction of deferred tax assets due to the disallowance of certain interest deductions and the change in the reporting currency for certain carryover attributes, and the amortization on previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.
Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting additions to property, plant, and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. Free cash flow should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable U.S.
GAAP measure) and free cash flow are as follows:
Fiscal Year
(in millions) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 6,787 $ 6,039 Additions to property, plant, and equipment (1,587) (1,459)
Free cash flow $ 5,200 $ 4,580 Refer to the Summary of Cash Flows section for drivers of the change in cash provided by operating activities.

The increase in net sales for fiscal year 2024 was driven by growth in most businesses, including Surgical, Cranial & Spinal Technologies, Diabetes, and Cardiac Pacing, as well as strength in international markets. The net sales increase was partially offset by a $265 million one- time payment received in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 as a result of an intellectual property agreement, as further discussed in the Cardiovascular net sales section below.

Looking ahead, a number of macro-economic and geopolitical factors could negatively impact our business, including without limitation:
• Competitive product launches and pricing pressure, geographic macro-economic risks including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, general price inflation, changes in interest rates, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, delays in product registration approvals, replacement cycle challenges, and supply chain challenges from time to time; • National and provincial tender pricing for certain products, particularly in China; • The sanctions and other measures being imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine conflict are having and could continue to have impacts on revenue and supply chain. The financial impact of the conflict in fiscal year 2024, including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material. For fiscal year 2024, the business of the Company in these countries represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues and assets. Although the implications of this conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the ongoing conflict may increase pressure on the global economy and supply chains, resulting in increased future volatility risk for our business operations and performance.
• Although the long-term implications of Israel's conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the financial and operational impact of the conflict in fiscal year 2024, including on accounts receivable and inventory reserves, was not material. As of April 26, 2024, the Company had 6 facilities and approximately 1,500 employees in Israel. For fiscal year 2024, the business of the Company in Israel represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated revenues and assets.
Cardiovascular Cardiovascular products include pacemakers, insertable cardiac monitors, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, leads and delivery systems, electrophysiology catheters, products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, information systems for the management of patients with Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure devices, products designed to reduce surgical site infections, coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems, balloons and related delivery systems, endovascular stent graft systems, heart valve replacement technologies, cardiac tissue ablation systems, and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products. Cardiovascular also includes Care Management Services and Cath Lab Managed Services (CLMS) within the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure division. Cardiovascular net sales for fiscal year 2024 were $11.8 billion, an increase of 3 percent as compared to fiscal year 2023. The net sales increase was primarily due to the strong performance of Micra, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and Perfusion.
The charts below illustrate the percent of Cardiovascular net sales by division for fiscal years 2024 and 2023:
Fiscal year 2024 Fiscal year 2023 20.9% 20.6% 50.7% 50.2% 28.4% 29.2%
CRHF SHA CPV CRHF SHA CPV
Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) net sales increased 4 percent in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023. The net sales increase was driven by continued adoption of Micra AV2 and Micra VR2 and growth from the launch of the PulseSelect pulsed field ablation (PFA) system and the Aurora extravascular implantable cardioverter defibrillator (EV-ICD) system.

Structural Heart & Aortic (SHA) net sales were flat in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023. Net sales were impacted by the $265 million of revenue from a one-time payment received in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 as a result of the intellectual property agreement entered into with Edwards Lifesciences, offset by growth in TAVR, including strong growth in Western Europe and Japan from adoption of Evolut FX TAVR system, and in Cardiac Surgery driven by growth of Perfusion, particularly in the U.S.
Coronary & Peripheral Vascular (CPV) net sales increased 4 percent in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023. The net sales increase was driven by growth from guide catheters, balloons, as well as growth in Vascular Embolization products.
In addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Net Sales section, looking ahead, we expect Cardiovascular could be affected by the following:
• Continued global penetration of our Micra transcatheter pacing portfolio.

The products include those for advanced and general surgical products, surgical stapling devices, vessel sealing instruments, wound closure, electrosurgery products, hernia mechanical devices, mesh implants, advanced ablation, interventional lung, airway products, and sensors and monitors for pulse oximetry, capnography, level of consciousness and cerebral oximetry. Medical Surgical’s net sales for fiscal year 2024 were $8.4 billion, an increase of 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2023. The net sales increase was primarily driven by strength across both Surgical & Endoscopy and Acute Care & Monitoring.
The charts below illustrate the percent of Medical Surgical net sales by division for fiscal years 2024 and 2023:
Fiscal year 2024 Fiscal year 2023 22.7% 23.0% 77.3% 77.0%
SE ACM SE ACM
Surgical & Endoscopy (SE) net sales for fiscal year 2024 increased 6 percent as compared to fiscal year 2023. The net sales increase was predominantly attributable to growth in Advanced Surgical Technologies and General Surgical Technologies, primarily driven by supply expansion, as well as continued growth in Advanced Energy, Wound Management, Electrosurgery, GI Genius, and EndoFlip.
Acute Care & Monitoring (ACM) net sales for fiscal year 2024 increased 4 percent as compared to fiscal year 2023. The net sales increase was primarily driven by growth in Nellcor pulse oximetry products and McGRATH MAC video laryngoscopes.
In addition to the macro-economic and geopolitical factors described in the Net Sales section, looking ahead we expect Medical Surgical could be affected by the following:
• Acceptance and continued growth of Open-to-MIS (minimally invasive surgery) techniques and tools through our efforts to transition open surgery to MIS. Open-to-MIS initiative focuses on capturing the market opportunity that exists in transitioning open procedures to MIS, whether through traditional MIS, advanced instrumentation, or robotics. Through our approach, in parallel, we also expand our presence and optimize open surgery in current open surgery markets.
• Continued global acceptance and future growth of powered stapling and energy platform.

• Market acceptance and growth of our InPen smart pen system, which allows users to have their Medtronic CGM readings in real- time alongside insulin dose information, all in one view.
• Continued pump, CGM, and consumable competition in an expanding global market.
• Changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs, along with additional payor coverage on insulin pumps.
• Our ability to meet growing demand for our existing products and to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize the products within our pipeline, including our next-generation sensor Simplera, which has been submitted for approval to the U.S. FDA and received CE Mark in September 2023.

COSTS AND EXPENSES
The following is a summary of cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales:
34.7% 34.3% 33.2% 33.4% 8.5% 8.6% Cost of products sold Research and development expense Selling, general, and administrative expense Fiscal year 2024 Fiscal year 2023 Cost of Products Sold Cost of products sold for fiscal year 2024 was $11.2 billion as compared to $10.7 billion for fiscal year 2023. The increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to increased labor and direct material manufacturing costs, predominantly due to inflationary pressures, as well as $70 million of inventory write-downs associated with our February 2024 decision to exit our ventilator product line. For additional information about the ventilator inventory write-down, refer to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and Development Expense We remain committed to deliver the best possible experiences for patients, physicians, and caregivers we serve; to create technologies that expand what’s possible across the human body to transform lives; to turn data and insights into real action to serve patient needs, improving care; and to expand healthcare access and deliver positive outcomes. Research and development expense was $2.7 billion for fiscal years 2024 and 2023.
Selling, General, and Administrative Expense Our goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense management initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages, other administrative costs, such as professional fees and marketing expenses, certain acquisition and divestiture-related costs, and restructuring associated expenses.
Selling, general, and administrative expense for fiscal year 2024 was $10.7 billion as compared to $10.4 billion for fiscal year 2023. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expense is primarily due to reduced incentive performance in the prior year.
The following is a summary of other costs and expenses (income):
Fiscal Year
(in millions) 2024 2023 Amortization of intangible assets $ 1,693 $ 1,698 Restructuring charges, net 226 375 Certain litigation charges, net 149 (30)
Other operating expense (income), net 464 (131)
Other non-operating income, net (412) (515)
Interest expense, net 719 636 Amortization of Intangible Assets Amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization expense of our definite-lived intangible assets, consisting of purchased patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and other intangible assets.

Restructuring Charges, Net In fiscal year 2024, restructuring costs primarily related to employee termination benefits and facility consolidations to support cost reduction initiatives. In fiscal year 2023, restructuring charges primarily related to the Enterprise Excellence and Simplification restructuring programs, both of which were substantially completed as of the end of fiscal year 2023. Enterprise Excellence was designed to leverage the Company’s global size and scale to focus on global operations, and functional and commercial optimization, and had total cumulative pre-tax charges of $1.8 billion. Simplification was designed to focus the organization on accelerating innovation, enhancing customer experience, driving revenue growth and winning market share, and had total cumulative pre-tax charges of $0.5 billion. In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred $0.3 billion of restructuring charges primarily related to employee termination benefits to support cost reduction initiatives. These charges were incremental to charges incurred under our Enterprise Excellence and Simplification programs noted above.
For additional information about our restructuring programs, refer to Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Certain Litigation Charges, Net We classify specified certain litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges, net in the consolidated statements of income. For additional information, refer to Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net primarily includes royalty expense, currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, certain acquisition and-divestiture related items, income from funded research and development arrangements, and commitments to the Medtronic Foundation and Medtronic LABS.
The change in other operating expense (income), net was largely driven by an increase in acquisition and divestiture-related expenses in fiscal year 2024. In fiscal year 2024, there were $369 million of charges related to the Company's decision to exit the ventilator product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, which primarily included intangible asset impairments of $295 million and other charges for contract cancellation costs and severance. Fiscal year 2023 included non-cash charges of $136 million, primarily related to impairments of goodwill and changes in the carrying value of the disposal group, as a result of the April 1, 2023 sale of half of the Company's RCS business. Also contributing to the increase in acquisition and divestiture related expenses was a change in the fair value of contingent consideration, which resulted in $156 million of expense in fiscal year 2024 as compared to $24 million of income in fiscal year 2023.
The change in other operating expense (income), net was also driven by the net currency impact of remeasurement expense and our hedging programs, which resulted in a net gain of $68 million combined for fiscal year 2024 as compared to a net gain of $465 million for fiscal year 2023, partially offset by a decrease of $94 million in Puerto Rico Excise Taxes. As a result of newly enacted tax legislation in Puerto Rico, the Company is no longer subject to Puerto Rico Excise Tax, but is now subject to a higher withholding tax, which is recorded in income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. Fiscal year 2023 also included $70 million in commitments to the Medtronic Foundation and Medtronic LABS.
Additional information regarding the acquisition and divestiture-related charges is described in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net includes the non-service component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income.
The decrease in other non-operating income, net for fiscal year 2024 is primarily attributable to an increase in net losses on our minority investment portfolio, partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by higher returns on cash and cash equivalents and investments. Net losses on minority investments were $308 million for fiscal year 2024 as compared to a net gain of $33 million for fiscal year 2023. Interest income was $597 million and $386 million for fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net includes interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts, amortization of amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of certain net investment hedges, and charges recognized in connection with the early redemption of senior notes.
The increase in interest expense, net for fiscal year 2024 was primarily driven by increased rates on our global liquidity structures, the impact of higher coupons on Senior Notes issued in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, and the higher outstanding commercial paper balance. Partially offsetting the increase for fiscal year 2024 was $197 million in after-tax unrealized gains representing amounts excluded from the effectiveness assessment of certain net investment hedges as compared to $107 million for fiscal year 2023. Also partially offsetting the increase in interest expense, net was the $53 million charge incurred as a result of the early redemption of approximately $2.3 billion of senior notes during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023.

INCOME TAXES
Fiscal Year
(in millions) 2024 2023 Income tax provision $ 1,133 $ 1,580 Income before income taxes 4,837 5,364 Effective tax rate 23.4 % 29.5 % Non-GAAP income tax provision $ 1,327 $ 1,128 Non-GAAP income before income taxes 8,273 8,194 Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate 16.0 % 13.8 % Difference between the effective tax rate and Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate (7.4) % (15.7) % The Israeli Central-Lod District Court issued its decision in Medtronic Ventor Technologies Ltd (Ventor) v. Kfar Saba Assessing Office in June 2023. The court determined that there was a deemed taxable transfer of intellectual property. As a result, the Company recorded a $187 million income tax charge during fiscal year 2024 and filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Israel.
Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 was 23.4 percent, as compared to 29.5 percent in fiscal year 2023. The decrease in our effective tax rate primarily relates to the decrease in certain tax adjustments discussed below which is partially offset by an increase in Puerto Rico withholding taxes and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction.
Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year 2024 was 16.0 percent, as compared to 13.8 percent in fiscal year 2023. The increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate primarily relates to an increase in Puerto Rico withholding taxes and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction, inclusive of the operational tax costs and benefits discussed below.
During fiscal year 2024, we recognized $19 million of operational tax costs. The operational tax costs included a $16 million cost from the impact of stock-based compensation, and a $3 million net cost associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, and changes to uncertain tax position reserves.
During fiscal year 2023, we recognized $110 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included an $11 million cost from the impact of stock-based compensation, and a $121 million benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances.
An increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate of one percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 of approximately $83 million and $82 million, respectively.
Certain Tax Adjustments
During fiscal year 2024, the net cost from certain tax adjustments of $299 million, recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:
• A cost of $187 million associated with a reserve adjustment related to the Israeli Central-Lod District Court decision with respect to a deemed taxable transfer of intellectual property.
• A cost of $124 million related to a change in valuation allowance on previously recorded net operating losses.
• A benefit of $95 million related to a Swiss Cantonal tax rate change on previously recorded deferred tax assets.
• A cost of $50 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.
• A cost of $33 million associated with a change in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion on certain historical earnings.
During fiscal year 2023, the net cost from certain tax adjustments of $910 million, recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:
• A net cost of $764 million associated with a reserve adjustment that was a direct result of the U.S. Tax Court opinion, issued in August 2022, on the prior year previously disclosed litigation regarding the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico.
• A cost of $55 million related to the disallowance of certain interest deductions.

• A cost of $30 million related to the change in reporting currency for certain carryover attributes.
• A cost of $28 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.
• A net cost of $33 million primarily associated with the sale of half of the Company’s RCS business.
Certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods. Therefore, we consider these Non-GAAP Adjustments. Refer to the "Executive Level Overview" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of these adjustments.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15% in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2025. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impacts of proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. There are no impacts of this global minimum tax in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024.
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
We are currently in a strong financial position, and we believe our balance sheet and liquidity as of April 26, 2024 provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments, along with our credit facility and related commercial paper programs will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs.
Our liquidity and capital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning processes. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, property, plant, and equipment, and other operating costs. We also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, satisfying maturing debt, and acquiring businesses and technology.
Summary of Cash Flows The following is a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, and the net change in cash and cash equivalents:
Fiscal Year
(in millions) 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used in):
Operating activities $ 6,787 $ 6,039 Investing activities (2,366) (3,493)
Financing activities (4,450) (4,960)
Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (230) 243 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (259) $ (2,171)
Operating Activities The $748 million increase in net cash provided was primarily driven by an increase in cash collected from customers due to an increase in sales. The increase in net cash was partially offset by timing of payments to vendors, as well as an increase in cash paid for interest and litigation. For more information on litigation payments, refer to Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Investing Activities The $1.1 billion decrease in net cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $1.7 billion, partially offset by an increase in net purchases of investments of $136 million and cash paid for additions of property, plant, and equipment of $128 million. For more information on the acquisitions, refer to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Financing Activities There was a $510 million decrease in net cash used primarily due to proceeds from commercial paper in the current year and prior year net debt repayments, partially offset by increased share repurchases. In the current period, there was an increase in commercial paper that was issued and outstanding at year-end of $1.1 billion. This increase in cash provided by financing activities was offset by an increase in share repurchases of $1.5 billion. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company issued two tranches of USD-denominated Senior Notes resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The Company used the net proceeds to repay in full the ¥297 billion Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement discussed below for $2.3 billion of total consideration.
In the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company issued four tranches of Euro-denominated Senior Notes for approximately $3.4 billion. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity €750 million of Medtronic Global Holdings S.C.A

(Medtronic Luxco) Senior Notes for $772 million of total consideration in December 2022 and €2.8 billion of Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $2.9 billion of total consideration in March 2023. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company issued short-term borrowings of approximately $2.3 billion under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement and used the proceeds to fund the early redemption of senior notes for total consideration of $2.3 billion. For more information on the issuance and redemption of senior notes and the Term Loan, refer to the Debt and Capital section.
Debt and Capital Our capital structure consists of equity and interest-bearing debt. We primarily utilize unsecured senior debt obligations to meet our financing needs and, to a lesser extent, bank borrowings. From time to time, we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.
Total debt at April 26, 2024 was $25.0 billion, as compared to $24.4 billion at April 28, 2023. The increase in total debt was driven by commercial paper outstanding of $1.1 billion, partially offset by fluctuations in exchange rates.
In May 2022, we entered into a term loan agreement (Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement) with Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for an aggregate principal amount of up to ¥300 billion with a term of 364 days. In May and June 2022, Medtronic Luxco borrowed an aggregate of ¥297 billion, or approximately $2.3 billion, of the term loan, under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement. The Company used the net proceeds of the borrowings to fund the early redemption of $1.9 billion of Medtronic Inc. Senior Notes for $1.9 billion of total consideration, and $368 million of Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $376 million of total consideration. The Company recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million within interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of income during fiscal year 2023, which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company repaid the term loan in full, including interest.
In September 2022, we issued four tranches of Euro-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of €3.5 billion, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2026 to 2035, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $3.4 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The Company used the net proceeds to repay at maturity €750 million of 0.000% Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $772 million of total consideration in December 2022 and €1.5 billion of 0.375% Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes and €1.25 billion of 0.000% Medtronic Luxco Senior Notes for $2.9 billion of total consideration in March 2023.
In March 2023, Medtronic Luxco issued two tranches of USD-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of $2.0 billion, with maturities ranging from 2028 to 2033, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $2.0 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The Company used the net proceeds supplemented by additional cash to repay the ¥297 billion Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement discussed above for $2.3 billion of total consideration.
Subsequent to year-end, on June 3, 2024, Medtronic Inc. issued four tranches of EUR-denominated Senior Notes with an aggregate principal of €3.0 billion, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2030 to 2054, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $3.2 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. In anticipation of the Euro-denominated debt issuance, the Company entered into forward currency exchange rate contracts to manage the exposure to exchange rate movements. These contracts were settled in conjunction with the issuance of the June 2024 Notes.
We repurchase our ordinary shares on occasion as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders. In March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $6.0 billion of the Company's ordinary shares. In March 2024, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an incremental $5.0 billion of the Company's ordinary shares. There is no specific time period associated with these repurchase authorizations. During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we repurchased a total of 25 million and 6 million shares, respectively, under these programs at an average price of $83.04 and $91.31, respectively. At April 26, 2024, we had approximately $5.3 billion remaining under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors.
For more information on credit arrangements, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Liquidity Our liquidity sources at April 26, 2024 included $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $6.7 billion of current investments.
Additionally, we maintain commercial paper programs and a Credit Facility.
Our investments primarily include available-for-sale debt securities, including U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, certificates of deposit, and other asset-backed securities. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding fair value measurements.
We maintain multicurrency commercial paper programs for short-term financing, which allow us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.5 billion. At April 26, 2024 and April 28,

2023, we had $1.1 billion and no commercial paper outstanding, respectively. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit, as explained below.
We also have a $3.5 billion five-year syndicated credit facility (Credit Facility), which expires in December 2028. At each anniversary date of the Credit Facility, we can request a one-year extension of the maturity date. The Credit Facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper programs and may also be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional $1.0 billion at any time during the term of the agreement. At April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility.
Interest rates on advances of our Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our long-term debt ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) and Moody's Investors Service (Moody’s). Facility fees are payable on the Credit Facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. We are in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Facility.
The following table is a summary of our S&P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings:
Agency Rating (1)
April 26, 2024 April 28, 2023 Standard & Poor's Ratings Services Long-term debt A A Short-term debt A-1 A-1
Moody's Investors Service
Long-term debt A3 A3 Short-term debt P-2 P-2 (1) Agency ratings are subject to change, and there may be no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings and/or maintain its current ratings.
A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.
S&P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings at April 26, 2024 were unchanged as compared to the ratings at April 28, 2023. We do not expect the S&P and Moody's ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet, Credit Facility, and related commercial paper programs.

Contractual Obligations and Cash Requirements We have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business, some of which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. We believe our off-balance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.
Presented below is a summary of our off-balance sheet contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at April 26, 2024, as well as long-term contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet at April 26, 2024.

While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in the table reflect our best estimates.
(2) Includes the contractual interest payments on our outstanding debt and excludes the impacts of debt premium and discount amortization. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements.
(3) Includes inventory purchase commitments, research and development, and other arrangements that are legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities or spending amounts. These purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business.
Excludes open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year.
(4) Excludes defined benefit plan obligations, guarantee obligations, uncertain tax positions, non-current tax liabilities, and litigation settlements for which we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement. For further information, see Notes 13, 15, and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
(5) Includes the current and non-current portion of our contractual maturities of debt, excluding deferred financing costs and debt discounts, net. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements.
(6) Includes the fair value of our current and non-current portions of contingent consideration. While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect our best estimates.
(7) Represents the tax obligations associated with the transition tax that resulted from U.S. Tax Reform. The transition tax will be paid over an eight-year period and will not accrue interest.
In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. Our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated, and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table above. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements.
Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to legal matters. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.
We record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries (to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax); however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts we consider to be permanently reinvested. We expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future. In addition, we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations, and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure, we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations.

Beyond the contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments outlined above, we have recurring cash requirements arising from the normal operation of our business that include capital expenditures, research and developments costs, and other operational costs.
We believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, current investments, Credit Facility and related commercial paper programs, as well as our ability to generate operating cash flows, will satisfy our current and future contractual obligations and cash requirements. We regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements.
ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS
Information regarding acquisitions and disposition activity is included in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
We have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Our critical accounting estimates include the following:
Revenue Recognition The Company sells its products through direct sales representatives and independent distributors. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals and royalty and intellectual property arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer. For products sold through direct sales representatives and independent distributors, control is transferred upon shipment or upon delivery, based on the contract terms and legal requirements. For consignment inventory, control is transferred when the product is used or implanted. Payment terms vary depending on the country of sale, type of customer, and type of product.
The amount of revenue recognized reflects sales rebates and returns, which are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim, the stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. The Company records adjustments to rebates and returns reserves as increases or decreases of revenue.
Litigation Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal actions from time to time involving product liability, employment, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company's complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions. Estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines, or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies when a loss is known or considered probable, and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed. Our significant legal proceedings are discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Income Tax Reserves We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations.

We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit, when there is (i) a completion of a tax audit, (ii) effective settlement of an issue, (iii) a change in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iv) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. These reserves are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.
Valuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identified net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets primarily include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and in-process research and development. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle. The estimates could be impacted by legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.
The test for impairment of goodwill requires us to make several estimates related to projected future cash flows to determine the fair value of the goodwill reporting units. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value. We assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually as of the first day of the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. As a result of our operating segment realignments during the current fiscal year, additional impairment of goodwill tests were performed. The results of the tests are disclosed in Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We also test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired. We assess the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.
Our tests for goodwill and intangible assets are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, appropriate discount rates, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. The test for goodwill also utilizes revenue and earnings multiples using comparable public company information. We use estimates that are consistent with the highest and best use of the assets based on a market participant's view of the assets being evaluated. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including, among others, changes in competitive conditions, timing of regulatory approval, results of clinical trials, changes in worldwide economic conditions, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK
Due to the global nature of our operations, we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes, which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows. Fluctuations in the currency exchange rates of currency exposures that are unhedged, such as in certain emerging markets, may result in future earnings and cash flow volatility. The gross notional amount of all currency exchange rate derivative instruments outstanding at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 was $23.7 billion and $22.0 billion, respectively. At April 26, 2024, these contracts were in a net unrealized gain position of $593 million. Additional information regarding our currency exchange rate derivative instruments is included in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all currency exchange rate derivative contracts at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 indicates that, if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened/weakened by 10 percent against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase/decrease by approximately $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.
INTEREST RATE RISK
We are subject to interest rate risk on our short-term investments and our borrowings. We manage interest rate risk in the aggregate, while focusing on our immediate and intermediate liquidity needs. Our debt portfolio at April 26, 2024 was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars and Euros, which is primarily fixed rate debt. We are also exposed to interest rate changes affecting our investments in interest rate sensitive instruments, which include our marketable debt securities.
A sensitivity analysis of the impact on our interest rate-sensitive financial instruments of a hypothetical 50 basis point change in interest rates, as compared to interest rates at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, indicates that the fair value of these instruments would change by $64 million and $61 million, respectively.
For a discussion of current market conditions and the impact on our financial condition and results of operations, see the “Liquidity” section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis in "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional discussion of market risk, see Notes 5 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Medtronic plc Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Medtronic plc and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 26, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended April 26, 2024 appearing under Item 15 (a)(1)
(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 26, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended April 26, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of April 26, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Income Tax Reserve for the Uncertain Tax Position Related to Puerto Rico Manufacturing As described in Notes 13 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements, management records reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities. A remaining unresolved issue with the IRS relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's manufacturing sites. These reserves are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment. Total reserves relating to uncertain tax positions as of April 26, 2024 were $2.824 billion, of which the Puerto Rico manufacturing reserve makes up a significant portion.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the income tax reserve for the uncertain tax position related to Puerto Rico manufacturing is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the reserve, including a high degree of estimation uncertainty relative to the unresolved issue with the IRS involving one of the Company’s manufacturing sites; and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s measurement of the income tax reserve for the uncertain tax position related to Puerto Rico manufacturing, as the nature of the evidence is often highly subjective.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the recognition of the income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions, as well as controls over measurement of the reserve for the uncertain tax position related to Puerto Rico manufacturing. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for determining the reserve, (ii) evaluating the status and results of the related U.S. Tax Court case, and (iii) evaluating the consistency of the reserve calculation with the relevant documents related to the U.S. Tax Court case.
Evaluating the reasonableness of the measurement of the reserve included evaluating whether the methodology and assumptions used by the Company were consistent with the U.S. Tax Court’s ruling.

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Medtronic plc (Medtronic or the Company) is the leading global healthcare technology company– alleviating pain, restoring health, and extending life for millions of people around the world. The Company provides innovative products and therapies to serve healthcare systems, physicians, clinicians, and patients. Medtronic was founded in 1949 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.
Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Medtronic plc, its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entities for which the Company has a controlling financial interest, and variable interest entities for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances have been fully eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform to classifications used in the current year. Amounts reported in millions within this annual report are computed based on the amounts in thousands, and therefore, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.
Use of Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.) (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used when accounting for items such as income taxes, contingencies, goodwill, intangible asset, equity investment, and liability valuations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.
Fiscal Year-End The Company utilizes a 52/53-week fiscal year, ending the last Friday in April, for the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 and for each of the three fiscal years ended April 26, 2024 (fiscal year 2024), April 28, 2023 (fiscal year 2023), and April 29, 2022 (fiscal year 2022).
Cash Equivalents The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.
Investments The Company invests in marketable debt and equity securities, investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option, investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, and investments accounted for under the equity method.
Marketable debt securities are classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These investments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value for available-for-sale securities is recorded, net of taxes, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines the appropriate classification of its investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determinations at each balance sheet date. The classification of marketable debt securities as current or long-term is based on the nature of the securities and the availability for use in current operations consistent with the Company's management of its capital structure and liquidity.
Certain of the Company’s investments in marketable equity securities and other securities are long-term, strategic investments in companies that are in various stages of development and are primarily included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets. The change in fair value of marketable equity securities is recognized within other non-operating income, net in the consolidated statements of income. At each reporting period, the Company makes a qualitative assessment considering impairment indicators to evaluate whether the investment is impaired. Equity method investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology, taking into consideration various assumptions including discount rate and all pertinent financial information available related to the investees, including the timing of anticipated product launches, historical financial results, and projections of future cash flows. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are measured using the measurement alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. Equity securities accounted for under the equity method are initially recorded at the amount of the Company’s investment and are adjusted each period for the Company’s share of the investee’s income or loss and dividends paid. Securities accounted for under the equity method are reviewed quarterly for changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events that suggest other than temporary impairment has occurred.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses The Company grants credit to customers in the normal course of business and maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for potential credit losses. When evaluating allowances for doubtful accounts, the Company considers various factors, including historical experience and customer-specific information. Uncollectible accounts are written-off against the allowance when it is deemed that a customer account is uncollectible.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The Company reduces the carrying value of inventories for items that are potentially excess, obsolete, or slow-moving based on changes in customer demand, technology developments, or other economic factors.

Property, Plant, and Equipment Property, plant, and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Additions and improvements that extend the lives of the assets are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The Company assesses property, plant, and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property, plant, and equipment asset groupings may not be recoverable. The cost of interest that is incurred in connection with significant ongoing construction projects is capitalized using a weighted average interest rate.
These costs are included in property, plant, and equipment and amortized over the useful life of the related asset. Upon retirement or disposal of property, plant, and equipment, the costs and related amounts of accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts. The difference, if any, between the net asset value and the proceeds, is recognized in earnings.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identified net assets of acquired businesses. The Company assesses goodwill for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level. The Company calculates the excess of each reporting unit's fair value over its carrying amount, including goodwill, utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and revenue and earnings multiples using comparable public company information. The test for impairment of goodwill requires the Company to make several estimates related to projected future cash flows and appropriate multiples to determine the fair value of the goodwill reporting units. Significant assumptions used in the reporting unit fair value measurements include forecasted cash flows, including revenue and expense growth rates, discount rates, and revenue and earnings multiples. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit.
Intangible assets include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and in-process research and development (IPR&D). Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight-line basis with estimated useful lives typically ranging from three to 20 years. Amortization is recognized within amortization of intangible assets in the consolidated statements of income. Intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group, which includes intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group, which includes intangible assets, may not be recoverable, the Company calculates the excess of an asset group's carrying value over its undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying value is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The fair value of an asset group, which includes intangible assets, is estimated by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis.
Acquired IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to those research and development projects that were primarily acquired in a business combination for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use. IPR&D is capitalized at its fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, and any development costs incurred after the acquisition are expensed as incurred.
The fair value of IPR&D is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. Upon achieving regulatory approval or commercial viability for the related product, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is accounted for as a definite-lived asset and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. If the project is not completed or is terminated or abandoned, the Company may have an impairment related to the IPR&D, which is charged to expense. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year, prior to moving to definite-lived, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment is calculated as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted future cash flow analysis. IPR&D with no alternative future use acquired outside of a business combination is expensed immediately.
Contingent Consideration Certain of the Company’s business combinations involve potential payment or receipt of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain product development milestones and/or contingent on the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones. The Company records contingent consideration at fair value at the date of acquisition or divestiture based on the consideration expected to be transferred, estimated as the probability-weighted future cash flows, discounted back to present value.
The fair value of contingent consideration is measured using projected payment dates, discount rates, probabilities of payment, and projected revenues (for revenue-based considerations). Projected revenues are based on the Company’s most recent internal operational budgets and long-range strategic plans. The discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies. Changes in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates, and projected payment dates may result in adjustments to the fair value measurements. Contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period using Level 3 inputs, and the change in fair value, including accretion for the passage of time, is recognized as income or expense within other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of income. Contingent consideration payments made or received soon after the acquisition date are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Contingent consideration payments not made or received soon after the acquisition date that are related to the acquisition date fair value are reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows, and amounts paid or received in excess of the original acquisition date fair value are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Self-Insurance The Company self-insures the majority of its insurable risks, including medical and dental costs, disability coverage, physical loss to property, business interruptions, workers’ compensation, comprehensive general, and product liability. Insurance coverage is obtained for risks required to be insured by law or contract. The Company uses claims data and historical experience, as applicable, to estimate liabilities associated with the exposures that the Company has self-insured.
Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical plans, defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S.
employees and many employees outside the U.S. See Note 15 for assumptions used in determining pension and post-retirement benefit costs and liabilities.
Derivatives The Company recognizes all derivative financial instruments in its consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with authoritative guidance on derivatives and hedging, and presents assets and liabilities associated with derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated as a cash flow hedge or hedges of net investments, based upon the exposure being hedged. See Note 7 for more information on the Company's derivative instruments and hedging programs.
Fair Value Measurements The Company follows the authoritative guidance on fair value measurements and disclosures with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on both a recurring and nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The authoritative guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability, based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The categorization of financial assets and financial liabilities within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels defined as follows:
• Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
• Level 3 - Inputs are unobservable for the asset or liability.
Financial assets that are classified as Level 1 securities include highly liquid government bonds within U.S. government and agency securities, mutual funds, short-term investments, and equity securities for which quoted market prices are available. In addition, the Company classifies currency forward contracts as Level 1 since they are valued using quoted market prices in active markets which have identical assets or liabilities.
The valuation for most fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2. Financial assets that are classified as Level 2 include corporate debt securities, government and agency securities, other asset-backed securities, certificates of deposits, and mortgage-backed securities whose value is determined using inputs that are observable in the market or may be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data such as pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions, cash flow models with yield curves, and benchmark securities. In addition, total return swaps are included in Level 2 as the Company uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis.
Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable. Financial assets that are classified as Level 3 include certain investment securities for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation, equity method investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option, and auction rate securities. The investment securities with limited market activity are valued using third-party pricing sources that incorporate transaction details such as contractual terms, maturity, timing, and amount of expected future cash flows, as well as assumptions about liquidity and credit valuation adjustments by market participants. The fair value of auction rate securities is estimated by the Company using a discounted cash flow model, which incorporates significant unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company’s auction rate securities are years to principal recovery and the illiquidity premium that is incorporated into the discount rate.
Valuation techniques for investments valued using the fair value option are included in the "Investments" section above. For goodwill, other

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
intangible assets, and IPR&D, inputs used in the fair value analysis fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value.
Certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient include equity and fixed income commingled trusts, partnership units, and registered investment companies.
Revenue Recognition The Company sells its products through direct sales representatives and independent distributors. Additionally, a portion of the Company's revenue is generated from consignment inventory maintained at hospitals and royalty and intellectual property arrangements. The Company recognizes revenue when control is transferred to the customer. For products sold through direct sales representatives and independent distributors, control is typically transferred upon shipment or upon delivery, based on the contract terms and legal requirements. For consignment inventory, control is transferred when the product is used or implanted. Payment terms vary depending on the country of sale, type of customer, and type of product.
If a contract contains more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling price. Shipping and handling is treated as a fulfillment activity rather than a promised service, and therefore, is not considered a performance obligation. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on, and concurrent with, a specific revenue producing transaction and collected by the Company from customers (for example, sales, use, value added, and some excise taxes) are not included in revenue. For contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, the Company uses the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and does not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money.
The amount of revenue recognized reflects sales rebates and returns, which are estimated based on sales terms, historical experience, and trend analysis. In estimating rebates, the Company considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the rebate claim, the stated rebate rates, and other relevant information. The Company records adjustments to rebates and returns reserves as increases or decreases of revenue.
The Company records a deferred revenue liability if a customer pays consideration, or the Company has the right to invoice, before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer. Deferred revenue primarily represents remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance, for which consideration is received at the same time as consideration for the device or equipment. Revenue related to remote monitoring services and equipment maintenance is recognized over the service period as time elapses.
Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs incurred to physically move product from the Company's premises to the customer's premises are recognized in selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income and were $341 million, $351 million, and $354 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Other shipping and handling costs incurred to store, move, and prepare products for shipment are recognized in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of income.
Research and Development Research and development costs are expensed when incurred. Research and development costs include costs of research, engineering, and technical activities to develop a new product or service or make significant improvement to an existing product or manufacturing process. Research and development costs also include pre-approval regulatory and clinical trial expenses and license payments for technology not yet approved by regulators.
Contingencies The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed.
Income Taxes The Company has deferred taxes that arise as a result of the different treatment of transactions for U.S. GAAP and income tax accounting, known as temporary differences. The Company records the tax effect of these temporary differences as deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that may be used as a tax deduction or credit in a tax return in future years for which the Company has already recognized the tax benefit in the consolidated statements of income. The Company establishes valuation allowances for deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense for which payment has been deferred or expense has already been taken as a deduction on the Company’s tax return but has not yet been recognized as an expense in the consolidated statements of income. See Footnote 13 for more information on the Company's uncertain tax positions and tax policies.
Other Operating Expense (Income), Net Other operating expense (income), net primarily includes royalty expense, currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, certain

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
acquisition and divestiture-related items, income from funded research and development arrangements, and commitments to the Medtronic Foundation and Medtronic LABS.
Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net includes the non-service component of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income.
Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency entities are translated to U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, and the currency impacts arising from the translation of the assets and liabilities are recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, on the consolidated balance sheets. Elements of the consolidated statements of income are translated at the average monthly currency exchange rates in effect during the period. Currency transaction gains and losses are included in other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of income.
Stock-Based Compensation The Company measures stock-based compensation expense at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes the compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The amount of stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are expected to vest. The Company estimates pre-vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revises the estimates in subsequent periods.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
Supplier Finance Programs
In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-04, Liabilities— Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50), which requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program’s nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The Company adopted this guidance on April 29, 2023. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.
Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards
Segment Reporting
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Segment Reporting (Topic 280), which requires incremental disclosures on reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures on significant segment expenses. The Company will adopt this guidance beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 for our annual report and for interim periods starting in fiscal year 2026. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.
Income Taxes
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (Topic 740), which requires incremental annual disclosures on income taxes, including rate reconciliations, income taxes paid, and other disclosures. The Company will adopt this guidance beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2026 for our annual report. We are currently evaluating the potential effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.
2. Revenue The Company's revenues are principally derived from device-based medical therapies and services related to cardiac rhythm disorders, cardiovascular disease, neurological disorders and diseases, spinal conditions and musculoskeletal trauma, chronic pain, urological and digestive disorders, ear, nose, and throat conditions, and diabetes conditions as well as advanced and general surgical care products, respiratory and monitoring solutions, and neurological surgery technologies. The Company's primary customers include healthcare systems, clinics, third-party healthcare providers, distributors, and other institutions, including governmental healthcare programs and group purchasing organizations. Prior period revenue has been recast to reflect the new reporting structure. The activity of the Company's Renal Care Solutions business and the ventilator product line were moved out of Medical Surgical and into the Other line, and the retained PMRI businesses were combined into one business unit called Acute Care & Monitoring in Medical Surgical. Refer to Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company's reporting structure.

The amount of revenue recognized is reduced by sales rebates and returns. Adjustments to rebates and returns reserves are recorded as increases or decreases to revenue. At April 26, 2024, $1.0 billion of rebates were classified as other accrued expenses, and $574 million of rebates were classified as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet. At April 28, 2023, $1.1 billion of rebates were classified as other accrued expenses, and $555 million of rebates were classified as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheet. During fiscal year 2024, adjustments to rebate and return reserves recognized in revenue that were included in the rebate and return reserves at the beginning of the period were not material.

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Deferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations Deferred revenue at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 was $453 million and $405 million, respectively. At April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, $352 million and $314 million was included in other accrued expenses, respectively, and $101 million and $91 million was included in other liabilities, respectively. During the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024, the Company recognized $324 million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of April 28, 2023. During the fiscal year ended April 28, 2023, the Company recognized $240 million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue at April 29, 2022.
Remaining performance obligations include goods and services that have not yet been delivered or provided under existing, noncancellable contracts with minimum purchase commitments. At April 26, 2024, the estimated revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to unsatisfied performance obligations for executed contracts with an original duration of one year or more was approximately $0.5 billion. The Company expects to recognize revenue on the majority of these remaining performance obligations over the next two years.
3. Acquisitions and Dispositions
Acquisition Activity
The Company had acquisitions during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 that were accounted for as business combinations. The assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were recorded and consolidated on the acquisition date at their respective fair values. Goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to future, yet to be defined technologies, new customer relationships, existing workforce of the acquired businesses, and synergies expected to arise after the Company's acquisition of these businesses. The results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income since the date each business was acquired. The results of operations of acquired businesses and the pro forma impact of the acquisitions during fiscal years 2024 and 2023 was not significant, either individually or in the aggregate, to the consolidated results of the Company. Purchase price allocation adjustments for fiscal years 2024 and 2023 business combinations were not significant.
Fiscal Year 2024 The acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired during the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024 was $335 million. Based on preliminary valuations, assets acquired were primarily comprised of $131 million of goodwill, $150 million of IPR&D, and $29 million of technology- based intangible assets with estimated useful lives of 10 years. For tax purposes, $51 million of goodwill is deductible while $80 million is not deductible. The Company recognized $30 million of non-cash contingent consideration liabilities in connection with these business combinations during the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024, which are comprised of revenue and product development milestone-based payments.
Fiscal Year 2023
Intersect ENT
On May 13, 2022, the Company acquired Intersect ENT, a global ear, nose, and throat (ENT) medical technology leader. The acquisition expands the Neuroscience segment portfolio of products used during ENT procedures, and combined with the Company's navigation, powered instruments, and existing tissue health products, offers a broader suite of solutions to assist surgeons treating patients who suffer from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for the transaction, in which the Company acquired all outstanding shares of Intersect ENT for $28.25 per share, was $1.2 billion consisting of $1.1 billion of cash and $98 million previously held investments in Intersect ENT. The Company acquired $615 million of goodwill, $635 million of technology-based intangible assets, $35 million of customer-related intangible assets, and $13 million of tradenames with estimated useful lives of 20 years. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Revenue and net loss attributable to Intersect ENT since the date of acquisition as well as costs incurred in connection with the acquisition included in the consolidated statements of income were not significant for fiscal year 2023.
Affera, Inc.
On August 30, 2022, the Company acquired Affera, Inc. (Affera) a privately-held company focused on the development of cardiac mapping and navigation systems and catheter-based cardiac ablation technologies. The acquisition expands the Cardiovascular segment suite of advanced cardiac ablation products and accessories, including its first cardiac mapping and navigation platform. Total consideration, net of cash acquired for the transaction, was $904 million. The Company acquired $660 million of goodwill and $300 million of IPR&D, which was capitalized into intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company recognized $201 million of non-cash contingent consideration liabilities in connection with the acquisition, which are comprised of product development milestone-based payments. Revenue and net loss attributable to Affera since the date of acquisition as well as costs incurred in connection with the acquisition included in the consolidated statements of income were not significant for fiscal year 2023.

Other Acquisitions
For acquisitions, other than Intersect ENT and Affera, the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired during fiscal year 2023 was $123 million. Assets acquired were primarily comprised of $66 million of goodwill and $57 million of technology-based intangible assets with estimated useful lives of 16 years. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The Company recognized $73 million of non-cash contingent consideration liabilities in connection with these acquisitions during fiscal year 2023, which are comprised of revenue and product development milestone-based payments.
Disposal Activity
Ventilator Product Line Exit
On February 20, 2024, the Company announced the decision to exit its ventilator product line and retain and combine the remaining Patient Monitoring and Respiratory Interventions (PMRI) businesses into one business unit called Acute Care and Monitoring (ACM). In connection with this decision, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $439 million, including $369 million recognized within other operating expense (income), net and $70 million recognized in cost of products sold in the consolidated statements of income in fiscal year 2024. The charges included $371 million of non-cash impairments and write-downs primarily related to $295 million of long-lived intangible asset impairments and $70 million of inventory-write downs. The other charges primarily related to contract cancellation costs and severance. The Company will continue to honor existing ventilator contracts to serve the needs of its customers and their patients.
Renal Care Solutions (RCS) Disposition On May 25, 2022, the Company and DaVita Inc. (DaVita) entered into a definitive agreement for the Company to sell half of its RCS business, and on April 1, 2023, completed the transaction. This sale is part of an agreement between Medtronic and DaVita to form a new, independent kidney care-focused medical device company (“Mozarc Medical” or "Mozarc") with equal equity ownership.

Contingent Consideration
Certain of the Company’s business combinations involve potential payment of future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain product development milestones and/or contingent on the acquired business reaching certain performance milestones. A liability is recorded for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration on the acquisition date. The fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured at each reporting period, and the change in fair value is recognized within other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of income.
The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 was $149 million and $206 million, respectively.
At April 26, 2024, $96 million was recorded in other accrued expenses, and $53 million was recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. At April 28, 2023, $34 million was reflected in other accrued expenses, and $171 million was reflected in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

Restructuring Charges In fiscal year 2024, the Company incurred $389 million of restructuring and associated costs primarily related to employee termination benefits and facility consolidations to support cost reduction initiatives. In fiscal years 2023 and 2022, restructuring costs primarily related to Enterprise Excellence and Simplification restructuring programs, both of which were substantially completed as of the end fiscal year 2023. Enterprise Excellence was designed to leverage the Company’s global size and scale to focus on global operations, and functional and commercial optimization, and had total cumulative pre-tax charges of $1.8 billion. Simplification was designed to focus the organization on accelerating innovation, enhancing customer experience, driving revenue growth and winning market share, and had total cumulative pre- tax charges of $0.5 billion. In addition, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company incurred $0.3 billion of restructuring charges primarily related to employee termination benefits to support cost reduction initiatives. These charges were incremental to charges incurred under our Enterprise Excellence and Simplification programs noted above.
Employee-related costs primarily consist of termination benefits provided to employees who have been involuntarily terminated and voluntary early retirement benefits in fiscal year 2023. Associated costs primarily include salaries and wages of employees that are fully- dedicated to restructuring programs, consulting fees, and asset write-offs.

The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. Changes in the ability to observe valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value hierarchy. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 during the fiscal years ended April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023. When a determination is made to classify an asset or liability within Level 3, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.

Equity Securities, Equity Method Investments, and Other Investments The Company holds investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, equity method investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option, equity investments without readily determinable fair values, investments accounted for under the equity method, and other investments. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are measured using quoted market prices. Equity method investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option are included within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value. To determine the fair value of these investments, the Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology, taking into consideration various assumptions including discount rate, and all pertinent financial information available related to the investees, including the timing of anticipated product launches, historical financial results, and projections of future cash flows. Equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, and that are not accounted for via the fair value option, are included within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as they are measured using the measurement alternative at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.
The following table summarizes the Company's equity and other investments at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, which are classified as primarily other assets in the consolidated balance sheets:

Mozarc Medical Investment
As further described in Note 3, on April 1, 2023 the Company sold half of its RCS business to Mozarc, and as a result of the transaction the Company retained a 50% equity interest in Mozarc. Although the equity investment provides the Company with the ability to exercise significant influence over Mozarc, the Company has elected the fair value option to account for this equity investment. The Company believes the fair value option best reflects the economics of the underlying transaction.
Under the fair value option, changes in the fair value of the investment are recognized through earnings each reporting period in other non- operating income, net in the consolidated statements of income. During the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024, the Company recognized a loss of $220 million, primarily driven by the timing of anticipated product launches, historical financial results, and projections of future cash flows.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the Mozarc investment for which the fair value option has been elected:

These contracts were settled in conjunction with the issuance of the June 2024 Notes.
The Euro-denominated debt issued in September 2022 is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of the Company's European operations. Refer to Note 7 for additional information regarding the net investment hedge.
Term Loan Agreements In May 2022, Medtronic Luxco entered into a term loan agreement (Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement) by and among Medtronic Luxco, Medtronic plc, Medtronic, Inc., and Mizuho Bank, Ltd. as administrative agent and as lender. The Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement provides an unsecured term loan in an aggregate principal amount of up to ¥300 billion with a term of 364 days. Borrowings under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement bear interest at the TIBOR Rate (as defined in the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement) plus a margin of 0.40% per annum. Medtronic plc and Medtronic, Inc. guaranteed the obligations of Medtronic Luxco under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement. In May and June 2022, Medtronic Luxco borrowed an aggregate of ¥297 billion, or approximately $2.3 billion, of the term loan, under the Fiscal 2023 Loan Agreement. The Company used the net proceeds of the borrowings to fund the early redemption of $1.9 billion of Medtronic Inc.'s 3.500% Senior Notes due 2025 for $1.9 billion of total consideration, and $368 million of Medtronic Luxco's 3.350% Senior Notes due 2027 for $376 million of total consideration. The Company recognized a total loss on debt extinguishment of $53 million within interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of income during fiscal year 2023, which primarily includes cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, the Company repaid the term loan in full, including interest.
Contractual maturities of debt for the next five fiscal years and thereafter, excluding deferred financing costs and debt discount, net, are as follows:

Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value At April 26, 2024, the estimated fair value of the Company’s Senior Notes was $21.2 billion compared to a principal value of $24.0 billion.
At April 28, 2023, the estimated fair value was $21.7 billion compared to a principal value of $24.5 billion. The fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for the publicly registered Senior Notes, which are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. The fair values and principal values consider the terms of the related debt and exclude the impacts of debt discounts and hedging activity.
7. Derivatives and Currency Exchange Risk Management The Company uses derivative instruments and foreign currency denominated debt to manage the impact that currency exchange rate and interest rate changes have on reported financial statements. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes.

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Cash Flow Hedges
The Company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to manage its exposure to the variability of future cash flows that are denominated in a foreign currency.
At inception, foreign currency forward and option contracts are designated as a cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction affects earnings. When the hedged transaction affects earnings, the gain or loss on the derivative is reclassified to earnings. Amounts excluded from the measurement of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. Cash flows are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
The Company's cash flow hedges will mature within the subsequent three-year period. At April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, the Company had $229 million and $93 million in after-tax unrealized gains, respectively, associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company expects that $158 million of after-tax net unrealized gains at April 26, 2024 will be recognized in the consolidated statements of income over the next 12 months.
Net Investment Hedges
The Company uses derivative instruments and foreign currency denominated debt to manage foreign currency risk associated with its net investment in foreign operations. The derivative instruments that the Company uses for this purpose may include foreign currency forward exchange contracts used on a standalone basis or in combination with option collars and standalone cross currency interest rate contracts.
For instruments that are designated as net investment hedges, the gains or losses are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The gains or losses are reclassified into earnings upon a liquidation event or deconsolidation of the foreign subsidiary.
Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in interest expense, net on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. During the twelve months ended April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, the Company recognized $197 million and $107 million, respectively, of after-tax unrealized gains related to excluded components in interest expense, net. The cash flows related to the Company’s derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are reported as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Cash flows attributable to amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Undesignated Derivatives
The Company uses foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the Company’s exposure to the change in the value of non- functional currency denominated assets, liabilities, and cash flows.
These foreign currency forward exchange rate contracts are not designated as hedges at inception, and therefore, changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in the consolidated statements of income. Cash flows related to the Company’s undesignated derivative contracts are reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows based on the nature of the derivative instrument.
Outstanding Instruments
The following table presents the contractual amounts of the Company's outstanding instruments:

Total $ 132 $ — $ (11) $ 121 Concentrations of Credit Risk Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of interest- bearing investments, derivative contracts, and trade accounts receivable. Global concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across many geographic areas. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business.
The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, and certain other financial instruments (including currency exchange rate and interest rate derivative contracts) with various major financial institutions. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standings of these financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one institution. In addition, the Company has collateral credit agreements with its primary derivatives counterparties. Under these agreements, either party is required to post eligible collateral when the market value of transactions covered by the agreement exceeds specific thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both parties. As of April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, the Company received net cash collateral of $101 million and $11 million, respectively,

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
from its counterparties. Cash collateral posted is recorded as a reduction in cash and cash equivalents, with the offset recorded as an increase in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Cash collateral received is recorded as an increase in cash and cash equivalents with the offset recorded in other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets.

April 26, 2024 $ 7,966 $ 11,644 $ 19,121 $ 2,255 $ 40,986 As further described in Note 19, the Company had changes to the operating segments during fiscal year 2024. As of the beginning of fiscal year 2024, the Medical Surgical portfolio was separated into two operating segments, and each new operating segment was considered a standalone reporting unit as of the beginning of fiscal year 2024. As a result of this change, the Company allocated all goodwill that was previously assigned to the Medical Surgical reporting unit to the Surgical/Endoscopy reporting unit and the Patient Monitoring/Respiratory Interventions (PMRI) reporting unit using a relative fair value allocation approach. The effected reporting units were tested for impairment before and after the alignment. No goodwill impairment was identified in either test as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2024.
Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Company's operating segments changed again resulting in the two reporting units created in the first quarter to be combined into the Medical Surgical reporting unit. All goodwill that was previously assigned to the two reporting units was combined into the Medical Surgical reporting unit.
The Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment charges during fiscal years 2024 or 2022. As a result of the agreement with DaVita, as disclosed in Note 3, the Company allocated $208 million of goodwill to the RCS business that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale during the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 and was subsequently sold on April 1, 2023. Upon allocation, a goodwill impairment test was performed for the RCS business, and the Company recognized $61 million of goodwill impairment charges during fiscal year 2023.
The goodwill impairment charges are recognized in other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of income.

During fiscal year 2024, the Company recognized $295 million of definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in connection with the decision to exit its ventilator product line. The intangible asset impairment charges primarily related to purchased technology, customer- related intangibles, and trade names. During fiscal year 2022, the Company recognized $409 million of definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in connection with the Company's decision to stop the distribution and sale of the Medtronic HVAD System. The intangible asset impairment charge primarily related to purchased technology and patents. The intangible asset impairment charges are recognized in other operating expense (income), net in the consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note 3 for additional information on what led to the impairments in fiscal year 2024 and 2022. The Company did not recognize any definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges during fiscal year 2023.
Indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges were not significant for fiscal year 2024, 2023, or 2022. Due to the nature of IPR&D projects, the Company may experience future delays or failures to obtain regulatory approvals to conduct clinical trials, failures of such clinical trials, delays or failures to obtain required market clearances, other failures to achieve a commercially viable product, or the discontinuation of certain projects, and as a result, may recognize impairment losses in the future.
Amortization Expense
Intangible asset amortization expense was $1.7 billion for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022. Estimated aggregate amortization expense by fiscal year based on the current carrying value and remaining estimated useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets at April 26, 2024, excluding any possible future amortization associated with acquired IPR&D which has not met technological feasibility, is as follows:

Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 329 $ 295 $ 297 Stock Options Options are granted at the exercise price, which is equal to the closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the grant date. The majority of the Company’s options are non-qualified options with a ten-year life and a four-year ratable vesting term. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model (Black-Scholes model) to determine the fair value of stock options at the grant date.
The fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes model requires management to make assumptions regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates, volatility of the Company’s stock price, and expected dividends. Expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility and an implied volatility of the Company’s ordinary shares. Implied volatility is based on market traded options of the Company’s ordinary shares.
The following table provides the weighted average fair value of options granted to employees and the related assumptions used in the Black- Scholes model:

Restricted Stock Restricted stock units are expensed over the vesting period and are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. The expense recognized for restricted stock units is equal to the grant date fair value, which is equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. The majority of the Company's restricted stock units either have a four-year ratable vesting term or cliff vest after three years. Restricted stock units are not considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. Dividend equivalent units are accumulated on restricted stock units during the vesting period.

Performance Share Units Performance share units typically cliff vest after three years. The awards include three metrics: relative total shareholder return (rTSR), revenue growth, and return on investor capital (ROIC). rTSR is considered a market condition metric, and the expense is determined at the grant date and will not be adjusted even if the market condition is not met. Revenue growth and ROIC are considered performance metrics, and the expense is recorded over the performance period, which will be reassessed each reporting period based on the probability of achieving the various performance conditions. The number of shares earned at the end of the three-year period will vary, based on only actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted. Performance share units are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Performance share units are not considered issued or outstanding ordinary shares of the Company. Dividend equivalent units are accumulated on performance share units for each component of the award during the vesting period.
The Company calculates the fair value of the performance share units for each component individually. The fair value of the rTSR metric will be determined using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value of the revenue growth and ROIC metrics are equal to the closing stock price on the grant date.

Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) The Company's shareholders approved the Medtronic plc 2024 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2024 Plan) on October 19, 2023, which provides for a maximum of 30 million ordinary shares to be purchased by participating employees.
The 2024 Plan replaced the Medtronic plc Amended and Restated 2014 Employees Stock Purchase Plan (2014 Plan) starting January 1, 2024. The 2024 Plan allows participating employees to purchase the Company's ordinary shares at a discount through payroll deductions.
The expense recognized for shares purchased under the Company’s 2014 Plan and 2024 Plan is equal to the 15 percent discount the employee receives. Employees purchased 3 million shares at an average price of $71.10 per share in fiscal year 2024. At April 26, 2024, approximately 29 million ordinary shares were available for future purchase under the 2024 Plan.

Tax assets, net $ 3,972 $ 3,654 No deferred taxes have been provided on the approximately $86.3 billion and $83.7 billion of undistributed earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, respectively, since these earnings have been, and under current plans will continue to be, permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. Due to the number of legal entities and jurisdictions involved, the complexity of the legal entity structure of the Company, and the complexity of the tax laws in the relevant jurisdictions, the Company believes it is not practicable to estimate, within any reasonable range, the amount of additional taxes which may be payable upon distribution of these undistributed earnings.
At April 26, 2024, the Company had approximately $11.3 billion of tax effected net operating loss carryforwards in certain non-U.S.
jurisdictions, of which $5.1 billion have no expiration, and the remaining $6.2 billion will expire during fiscal years 2025 through 2041.

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Included in these net operating loss carryforwards are $4.0 billion of tax effected net operating losses generated in fiscal year 2008 as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling from certain non-U.S. taxing authorities; and $5.1 billion of tax effected net operating losses generated during fiscal year 2023 as a result of an intercompany reorganization. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against these net operating losses, as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized. Certain of the remaining non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards of $2.2 billion have a valuation allowance recorded against the carryforwards, as management does not believe that it is more likely than not that these net operating losses will be utilized.
At April 26, 2024, the Company had $81 million of tax effected U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards, of which $56 million have no expiration. The remaining loss carryforwards will expire during fiscal years 2025 through 2036. For U.S. state purposes, the Company had $90 million of tax effected net operating loss carryforwards at April 26, 2024, $12 million of which have no expiration. The remaining U.S.
state loss carryforwards will expire during fiscal years 2025 through 2042.
At April 26, 2024, the Company also had $292 million of tax credits available to reduce future income taxes payable, of which $122 million have no expiration. The remaining credits will expire during fiscal years 2025 through 2043.
The Company has established valuation allowances of $13.3 billion and $11.3 billion at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, respectively, primarily related to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets which are primarily comprised of tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. The increase in the valuation allowance during fiscal year 2024 is primarily related to the finalization of certain tax returns as well as an increase in the Swiss Cantonal tax rate applied to previously recorded deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowances. These valuation allowances would result in a reduction to the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income if they are ultimately not required.
The Company’s effective income tax rate varied from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate as follows:
Fiscal Year
2024 2023 2022 U.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Increase (decrease) in tax rate resulting from:
U.S. state taxes, net of federal tax benefit 0.2 0.1 0.2 Research and development credit (2.2) (1.9) (1.3)
Puerto Rico excise tax — (1.0) (1.1)

Effective tax rate 23.4 % 29.5 % 8.3 % The Israeli Central-Lod District Court issued its decision in Medtronic Ventor Technologies Ltd (Ventor) v. Kfar Saba Assessing Office in June 2023. The court determined that there was a deemed taxable transfer of intellectual property. As a result, the Company recorded a $187 million income tax charge during fiscal year 2024 and filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Israel.
During fiscal year 2024, the net cost from certain tax adjustments of $299 million, recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:
• A cost of $187 million associated with a reserve adjustment related to the Israeli Central-Lod District Court decision with respect to a deemed taxable transfer of intellectual property.
• A cost of $124 million related to a change in valuation allowance on previously recorded net operating losses.
• A benefit of $95 million related to a Swiss Cantonal tax rate change on previously recorded deferred tax assets.

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
• A cost of $50 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.
• A cost of $33 million associated with a change in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion on certain historical earnings.
During fiscal year 2023, the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of $910 million, recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:
• A net cost of $764 million associated with the August 18, 2022 U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court) Opinion on the previously disclosed litigation regarding the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 (Opinion). While the Opinion rejected the IRS’s position and the Tax Court determined the methodology advanced by Medtronic was appropriate for purposes of determining the intercompany royalty rate between Puerto Rico and the U.S., it determined that the royalty rate should be higher, thereby increasing income allocated to the U.S. and consequently subject to U.S. tax. This case relates only to fiscal years 2005 and 2006. The Company has assumed the Tax Court findings will be applied for all years following fiscal year 2006.
• A cost of $55 million related to the disallowance of certain interest deductions.
• A cost of $30 million related to the change in reporting currency for certain carryover attributes.
• A cost of $28 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.
• A net cost of $33 million primarily associated with the sale of half of the Company’s RCS business.
During fiscal year 2022, the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of $50 million, recognized in income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:
• A benefit of $82 million associated with a step up in tax basis for Swiss Cantonal purposes.
• A benefit of $82 million related to a change in tax rates on intangible assets.
• A cost of $47 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions.
• A cost of $41 million associated with a change in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion on certain historical earnings.
• A net cost of $26 million primarily associated with an intercompany sale of assets.
Currently, the Company’s operations in Puerto Rico, Singapore, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and China have various tax holidays and tax incentive grants. The tax reductions as compared to the local statutory rate favorably impacted earnings by $229 million, $115 million, and $248 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and diluted earnings per share by $0.17, $0.09, and $0.18, in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The tax holidays are conditional upon the Company meeting certain thresholds required under statutory law. The tax incentive grants, unless extended, will expire between fiscal years 2025 and 2049. The tax incentive grants which expired during fiscal year 2024 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15% in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. A number of countries, including Ireland, have enacted legislation to implement the core elements of Pillar Two, which will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2025. The Company is continuing to evaluate the potential impacts of proposed and enacted legislative changes as new guidance becomes available. There are no impacts of this global minimum tax in the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024.

The Company had $2.8 billion, $2.7 billion, and $1.7 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits at April 26, 2024, April 28, 2023, and April 29, 2022, respectively. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:
Fiscal Year
(in millions) 2024 2023 2022 Gross unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of fiscal year $ 2,682 $ 1,661 $ 1,668 Gross increases:
Prior year tax positions 121 980 1 Current year tax positions 85 89 40 Gross decreases:
Prior year tax positions (2) (12) (29)
Settlements (55) (4) (8)
Statute of limitation lapses (7) (32) (11)
Gross unrecognized tax benefits at end of fiscal year 2,824 2,682 1,661 Cash advance paid to taxing authorities (934) (918) (859)
Gross unrecognized tax benefits at end of fiscal year, net of cash advance $ 1,890 $ 1,764 $ 802 If all of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits at April 26, 2024, April 28, 2023, and April 29, 2022 were recognized, $2.7 billion, $2.5 billion, and $1.6 billion would impact the Company’s effective tax rate, respectively. Although the Company believes that it has adequately reserved for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on the Company’s effective tax rate in future periods. The Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, net of cash advance, of $1.8 billion as a noncurrent liability. The Company estimates that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that its uncertain tax positions, excluding interest, could decrease by as much as $15 million, net as a result of statute of limitation lapses.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income and records the liability in the current or noncurrent accrued income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets, as appropriate. During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized gross interest expense of $134 million, $86 million, and $17 million, respectively, in income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. The Company had $19 million, $61 million, and $117 million of accrued gross interest and penalties at April 26, 2024, April 28, 2023, and April 29, 2022, respectively.
The Company reserves for uncertain tax positions related to unresolved matters with the IRS and other taxing authorities. These reserves are subject to a high degree of estimation and management judgment. Resolution of these significant unresolved matters, or positions taken by the IRS or other tax authorities during future tax audits, could have a material impact on the Company’s financial results in future periods.
The Company continues to believe that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and that it has meritorious defenses for its tax filings and will vigorously defend them during the audit process, appellate process, and through litigation in courts, as necessary.

14. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted number of ordinary shares outstanding, increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding had the potentially dilutive ordinary shares been issued, and reduced by the number of shares the Company could have repurchased with the proceeds from issuance of the potentially dilutive shares. Potentially dilutive ordinary shares include stock-based awards granted under stock-based compensation plans and shares committed to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan.
The table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:
Fiscal Year
(in millions, except per share data) 2024 2023 2022 Numerator:
Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders $ 3,676 $ 3,758 $ 5,039 Denominator:

15. Retirement Benefit Plans The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension plans, post-retirement medical plans, defined contribution savings plans, and termination indemnity plans, covering substantially all U.S. employees and many employees outside the U.S. The net expense related to these plans was $451 million, $494 million, and $459 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
In the U.S., the Company maintains qualified pension plans designed to provide guaranteed minimum retirement benefits to all eligible U.S.
participants. Pension coverage for non-U.S. employees is provided, to the extent deemed appropriate, through separate plans. In addition to the benefits provided under the qualified pension plan, retirement benefits associated with wages in excess of the IRS allowable limits are provided to certain employees under a non-qualified plan. U.S. and Puerto Rico employees are also eligible to receive a medical benefit component, in addition to normal retirement benefits, through the Company’s post-retirement benefits.
At April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, the funded status of the Company’s benefit plans was $484 million overfunded and $103 million overfunded, respectively.
During fiscal year 2023, the Company offered certain eligible U.S. employees voluntary early retirement packages, resulting in charges of $94 million, primarily related to U.S. pension benefits. The charges were recognized in restructuring charges, net in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 for additional information on restructuring charges.

In certain countries outside the U.S., fully funding pension plans is not a common practice, as funding provides no income tax benefit.
Consequently, certain pension plans were partially funded at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023. U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets consist of the following:

The full yield curve approach applies specific spot rates along the yield curve to their underlying projected cash flows in estimation of the cost components. The current yield curves represent high quality, long-term fixed income instruments.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions are determined using a building block approach, considering historical averages and real returns of each asset class. In certain countries, where historical returns are not meaningful, consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns.
Retirement Benefit Plan Investment Strategy The Company sponsors trusts that hold the assets for U.S. pension plans and other U.S.
post-retirement benefit plans, primarily retiree medical benefits. For investment purposes, the Medtronic U.S. pension and other U.S. post- retirement benefit plans employ similar investment strategies with different asset allocation targets.
The Company has a Qualified Plan Committee (the Plan Committee) that sets investment guidelines for U.S. pension plans and other U.S.
post-retirement benefit plans with the assistance of external consultants. These guidelines are established based on market conditions, risk tolerance, funding requirements, and expected benefit payments. The Plan Committee also oversees the investment allocation process, selects the investment managers, and monitors asset performance. As pension liabilities are long-term in nature, the Company employs a long-term total return approach to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan assets for a prudent level of risk. An annual analysis on the risk versus the return of the investment portfolio is conducted to justify the expected long-term rate of return assumption.
The investment portfolios contain a diversified allocation of investment categories, including equities, fixed income securities, hedge funds, and private equity. Securities are also diversified in terms of domestic and international, short- and long-term, growth and value styles, large cap and small cap stocks, and active and passive management.
Outside the U.S., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. There is significant variation in policy asset allocation from country to country. Local regulations, funding rules, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. The weighted average target asset allocations at April 26, 2024 for the plans are 42% equity securities, 34% debt securities, and 24% other.
The plans did not hold any investments in the Company’s ordinary shares at April 26, 2024 or April 28, 2023.

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
The Company’s U.S. plans target asset allocations at April 26, 2024, compared to the U.S. plans actual asset allocations at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 by asset category, are as follows:
Target U.S. Plans Allocation Actual Allocation April 26, 2024 April 26, 2024 April 28, 2023 Asset Category:
Equity securities 34 % 39 % 36 % Debt securities 51 40 46 Other 15 21 19 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Strong performance on equity securities during the fiscal year resulted in asset allocations different than targets. Management expects to move the allocations closer to target over the intermediate term.
Retirement Benefit Plan Asset Fair Values The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for retirement benefit plan assets measured at fair value:
Short-term investments: Short-term investments include money market funds. These investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active markets in which the individual security is traded.
Mutual funds: Comprised of investments in equity and fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of mutual funds are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are publicly reported.
Equity commingled trusts: Comprised of investments in equity securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of equity commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund daily at market close. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets which are determined using observable inputs. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.
Fixed income commingled trusts: Comprised of investments in fixed income securities held in pooled investment vehicles. The valuations of fixed income commingled trusts are based on the respective net asset values which are determined by the fund, either daily or monthly depending on the investment, at market close. The net asset values are reported by the investment manager based on the valuation of the underlying assets held by the fund, less its liabilities. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.
Partnership units: Partnership units include investment partnerships that provide exposure to long/short equity, absolute return strategies, private equity investments, and real estate investments. The net asset values are reported by the investment manager based on the valuation of the underlying assets held by the partnerships, less its liabilities. The net asset values are not publicly reported, and funds are valued at the net asset value practical expedient.
Registered investment companies: Valued at net asset values which are not publicly reported. The net asset values are calculated based on the valuation of the underlying assets. The underlying assets are valued at the quoted market prices of shares held by the plan at year-end in the active market on which the individual securities are traded.
Insurance contracts: Comprised of investments in collective (group) insurance contracts, consisting of individual insurance policies. The policyholder is the employer, and each member is the owner/beneficiary of their individual insurance policy. These policies are a part of the insurance company’s general portfolio and participate in the insurer’s profit-sharing policy on an excess yield basis.
Measurement using net asset value as a practical expedient is not used when it is determined to be probable that the fund will sell the investment for an amount different than the reported net asset value.
The methods described above may produce fair values that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.
Furthermore, while the Company believes its valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
The following tables provide information by level for the retirement benefit plan assets that are measured at fair value, as defined by U.S.
GAAP. Certain investments for which the fair value is measured using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient are not presented within the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented for these investments are intended to permit reconciliation to the total fair value of plan assets at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023.

The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classification on an annual basis. During the year, the Company reclassified certain investments in the U.S. pension plan from Level 3 to investments measured using net asset value as a practical expedient. Outside of the reclassification, there were no transfers into or out of Level 3 for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans during the fiscal years ended April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023.
Retirement Benefit Plan Funding It is the Company’s policy to fund retirement costs within the limits of allowable tax deductions.
During fiscal year 2024, the Company made discretionary contributions of approximately $32 million to the U.S. pension plan.
Internationally, the Company contributed approximately $40 million for pension benefits during fiscal year 2024. The Company anticipates that it will make contributions of $30 million and $45 million to its U.S. pension benefit plans and non-U.S. pension benefit plans, respectively, in fiscal year 2025. Based on the guidelines under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the various guidelines which govern the plans outside the U.S., the majority of anticipated fiscal year 2025 contributions will be discretionary. The Company believes that pension assets, returns on invested pension assets, and Company contributions will be able to meet its pension and other post-retirement obligations in the future.
Retiree benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are anticipated to be paid as follows:
(in millions) Gross Payments U.S. Pension Non-U.S. Pension
Fiscal Year Benefits Benefits
2025 $ 184 $ 71 2026 193 61 2027 201 66 2028 211 68 2029 218 74 2030 – 2034 1,165 417 Post-retirement Benefit Plans The net periodic benefit cost associated with the Company’s post-retirement benefit plans was income of $16 million, $11 million, and $20 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The Company’s projected benefit obligation for all post-retirement benefit plans was $235 million and $261 million at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, respectively. The Company’s fair value of plan assets for all post-retirement benefit plans was $308 million and $302 million at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, respectively. The post-retirement benefit plan assets at both April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023 primarily comprised of equity and fixed commingled trusts, consistent with the U.S. retirement benefit plan assets outlined in the fair value leveling tables above.
Defined Contribution Savings Plans The Company has defined contribution savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees and certain non-U.S. employees. The general purpose of these plans is to provide additional financial security during retirement by providing employees with an incentive to make regular savings. Company contributions to the plans are based on employee contributions

and Company performance. Expense recognized under these plans was $471 million, $390 million, and $403 million in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.
16. Leases The Company leases office, manufacturing, and research facilities and warehouses, as well as transportation, data processing, and other equipment. The Company determines whether a contract is a lease or contains a lease at inception date. Upon commencement, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and lease liability. Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities are the Company's obligation to make the lease payments arising from a lease. As the Company’s leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the Company’s lease liabilities are measured on a discounted basis using the Company's incremental borrowing rate. Lease terms used in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include only options to extend the lease that are reasonably certain to be exercised. Additionally, lease terms underlying the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities consider terminations that are reasonably certain to be executed.
The Company's lease agreements include leases that have both lease and associated nonlease components. The Company has elected to account for lease components and the associated nonlease components as a single lease component. The consolidated balance sheets do not include recognized assets or liabilities for leases that, at the commencement date, have a term of twelve months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that is reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company recognizes such leases in the consolidated statements of income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, the Company recognizes variable lease payments not included in its lease liabilities in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Variable lease payments for fiscal year 2024, 2023, and 2022 were not material.
The Company's lease agreements include leases accounted for as operating leases and those accounted for as finance leases. The right-of- use assets, lease liabilities, lease costs, cash flows, and lease maturities associated with the Company's finance leases were not material to the consolidated financial statements at April 26, 2024 or April 28, 2023 or for fiscal year 2024, 2023 and 2022. Finance lease right-of-use assets are included in property, plant, and equipment, net, and finance lease liabilities are included in current debt obligations and long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.
The following table summarizes the balance sheet classification of the Company's operating leases and amounts of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023:

Income arising from arrangements where the Company is the lessor is recognized within net sales in the consolidated statements of income and the Company's net investments in sales-type leases are included in other current assets and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Lessor income and the related assets and lease maturities were not material to the consolidated financial statements at or for the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023.

The income tax on gains and losses on investment securities in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 was an expense of $4 million, a benefit of $21 million, and a benefit of $51 million, respectively. During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, realized gains and losses on investment securities reclassified from AOCI were reduced by income taxes of $5 million, $9 million and $1 million, respectively. When realized, gains and losses on investment securities reclassified from AOCI are recognized within other non-operating income, net. Refer to Note 5 for additional information.
During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, the income tax on cumulative translation adjustment was an expense of $3 million, a benefit of $5 million, and a benefit of $8 million, respectively.
During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were no tax impacts on net investment hedges. Refer to Note 7 for additional information.
The net change in retirement obligations in other comprehensive income includes amortization of net actuarial losses included in net periodic benefit cost. The income tax on the net change in retirement obligations in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 resulted in an expense of $79 million, $6 million, and $134 million, respectively. During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, the gains and losses on defined benefit and pension items reclassified from AOCI were reduced by income taxes of $2 million, $9 million, and $20 million, respectively. When realized, net gains and losses on defined benefit and pension items reclassified from AOCI are recognized within other non-operating income, net. Refer to Note 15 for additional information.
The income tax on unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income before reclassifications during fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 was an expense of $103 million, $56 million, and $152 million, respectively. Amounts reclassified from AOCI related to cash flow hedges included income taxes of $66 million, $133 million, and $26 million for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. When realized, gains and losses on currency exchange rate contracts reclassified from AOCI are recognized within other operating expense (income), net or cost of products sold. Refer to Note 7 for additional information.

18. Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters
The Company and its affiliates are involved in a number of legal actions from time to time involving product liability, employment, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations, including those described below. With respect to governmental proceedings and investigations, like other companies in our industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation by national, state, and local governmental agencies in the United States and in other jurisdictions in which the Company and its affiliates operate. As a result, interaction with governmental agencies is ongoing. The Company’s standard practice is to cooperate with regulators and investigators in responding to inquiries. The outcomes of legal actions are not within the Company’s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures, result in lost revenues, or limit the Company's ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions.
The Company records a liability in the consolidated financial statements on an undiscounted basis for loss contingencies related to legal actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount may be reasonably estimated. If the reasonable estimate of a known or probable loss is a range, and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other, the minimum amount of the range is accrued. If a loss is reasonably possible but not known or probable, and may be reasonably estimated, the estimated loss or range of loss is disclosed.
When determining the estimated loss or range of loss, significant judgment is required. Estimates of probable losses resulting from litigation and governmental proceedings involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery, involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages, potentially involve penalties, fines or punitive damages, or could result in a change in business practice. The Company classifies certain specified litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges in the consolidated statements of income. During fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recognized $149 million of certain litigation charges, $30 million of certain litigation income, and $95 million of certain litigation charges, respectively. At April 26, 2024 and April 28, 2023, accrued litigation was approximately $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion, respectively. The ultimate cost to the Company with respect to accrued litigation could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. The Company includes accrued litigation in other accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. While it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the legal matters discussed below, the Company believes it is possible that the costs associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.
Intellectual Property Matters
At any given time, the Company is involved in litigation relating to patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (IP) rights, and licenses, acquisitions or other agreements relating to such rights. This litigation includes, but is not limited to, alleged infringement or misappropriation of IP rights, or breach of obligations related to IP rights, or other claims asserted by competitors, individuals, or, consistent with a growing trend across technology-intensive industries, other entities created specifically to fund IP litigation. While the outcome of these litigation matters is inherently uncertain, it is possible that the results of such litigation could require the Company to pay significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, and negatively impact the Company's ability to sell current or future products, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.
Colibri The Company is a defendant in patent litigation brought by Colibri Heart Valve LLC (Colibri) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Colibri alleges infringement of one patent by the Company’s Evolut family of transcatheter aortic valve replacement devices. The patent asserted by Colibri has expired. On February 8, 2023, a jury returned a verdict against the Company for approximately $106 million. In July 2023, the Company filed its appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Company has not recognized an expense in connection with this matter because it does not currently believe a loss is probable.
Product Liability Matters
Hernia Mesh Litigation
Starting in fiscal year 2020, plaintiffs began filing lawsuits against certain subsidiaries of the Company in U.S. state and federal courts that allege personal injury from hernia mesh products sold by those subsidiaries. As of May 15, 2024, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in lawsuits filed on behalf of approximately 8,350 individual plaintiffs, and certain plaintiffs’

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
law firms have advised the Company that they may file additional cases in the future. Approximately 6,700 plaintiffs have pending lawsuits in a coordinated proceeding in Massachusetts state court, where they have been consolidated before a single judge. Approximately 500 plaintiffs have pending lawsuits in a coordinated action in Minnesota state court, and there are approximately 1,150 actions coordinated in a federal Multidistrict Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts plus six one-off cases filed in other courts. The pending lawsuits relate almost entirely to hernia mesh products that have not been subject to recalls, withdrawals, or other adverse regulatory action. The Company has not recorded an expense related to damages in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.
Diabetes Pump Retainer Ring Litigation
Starting in fiscal year 2021, plaintiffs began filing lawsuits against the Diabetes operating unit in U.S. state and federal courts alleging personal injury from Series 600 insulin pumps with allegedly defective clear retainer rings that were subject to field corrective actions in 2019 and 2021. As of May 14, 2024, 27 lawsuits have been filed on behalf of a total of 107 individual plaintiffs, and certain plaintiffs’ law firms have notified the Company that they may file additional lawsuits in the future on behalf of thousands of additional claimants. Most of the filed suits are coordinated in California state court. The Company has not recorded an expense related to damages in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable. Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.
Environmental Proceedings
The Company is a successor to several investigation and cleanup actions at various stages related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites, including in Orrington, Maine. These projects relate to a variety of activities, including removal of solvents, metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater. The ultimate cost of site cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and alternative cleanup methods.
The Company is also a successor to a party named in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine in the early 2000's by the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Maine People's Alliance relating to mercury contamination of the Penobscot River and Bay and options for remediating such contamination. In March 2021, the parties notified the court that they had agreed on a settlement in principle of all issues in this matter, and in September 2022 the parties filed a joint motion for final approval by the court. In October 2022, the court issued a final order approving the settlement and the parties are working with consultants on implementation of remedial activities.
The final court order did not result in a change to the Company's previous accrual for this matter.
The Company's accrued expenses for these various environmental proceedings are included within accrued litigation as discussed above.
Anti-Corruption Matters
The Company has regular and ongoing interactions with governmental agencies, and its practice is to cooperate with such inquiries. In addition, from time to time, the Company self-discloses potential concerns to governmental regulators. Like many in the medical device industry or with international operations, the Company engages in periodic discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, and various authorities in China regarding certain activities, including in China. The Company is committed to regularly evaluating and, as appropriate, strengthening its anti-corruption compliance programs and practices. Any possible future determination that certain of our operations and activities, and/or those of our third-party distributors, are not in compliance with existing laws could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and equitable remedies in the United States or in other jurisdictions. The Company has not recorded an expense in connection with these matters because any potential loss is not currently probable and reasonably estimable.
Additionally, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from these matters.
Income Taxes
In March 2009, the IRS issued its audit report on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Medtronic, Inc. reached agreement with the IRS on some, but not all matters related to these fiscal years. The remaining unresolved issue for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 relates to the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico, which is one of the Company's key manufacturing sites. The U.S. Tax Court (Tax Court) reviewed this dispute, and in June 2016, issued an opinion with respect to the allocation of income between the parties for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 whereby it generally rejected the IRS’s position, but also made certain modifications to the Medtronic, Inc. tax returns as filed. In April 2017, the IRS filed a Notice of Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit regarding the Tax Court opinion. The U.S. Court of Appeals issued its opinion in August 2018 and remanded the case back to the Tax Court for additional factual findings. The Tax Court issued its second opinion in August 2022, the IRS filed a Notice of

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
Appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in September 2023, and Medtronic subsequently filed a cross-appeal in October 2023.
The IRS has issued its audit reports on Medtronic, Inc. for fiscal years 2007 through 2016. Medtronic, Inc. and the IRS have reached agreement on all significant issues except for the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for the businesses that are the subject of the U.S. Tax Court matter for fiscal years 2005 and 2006.
Medtronic, Inc.’s fiscal years 2017, 2018, and 2019 U.S. federal income tax returns are currently being audited by the IRS.
Covidien LP (a wholly owned subsidiary of Medtronic plc) has either reached agreement with the IRS or the statute of limitations has lapsed on its U.S. federal income tax returns through fiscal year 2020.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the income tax matters discussed above, the Company believes it is possible that charges associated with these matters could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.
Refer to Note 13 for additional discussion of income taxes.
Guarantees In the normal course of business, the Company and/or its affiliates periodically enter into agreements that require one or more of the Company and/or its affiliates to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of the Company or its affiliates’ products, the negligence of the Company's personnel, or claims alleging that the Company's products infringe on third-party patents or other intellectual property. The Company also offers warranties on various products. The Company’s maximum exposure under these guarantees is unable to be estimated. Historically, the Company has not experienced significant losses on these types of guarantees.
The Company believes the ultimate resolution of the above guarantees is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.
19. Segment and Geographic Information There were no changes to the reportable segments during the fiscal year ended April 26, 2024. We continue to have four reportable segments: Cardiovascular Portfolio, Neuroscience Portfolio, Medical Surgical Portfolio, and Diabetes Operating Unit. However, there were changes to the operating segments during fiscal year 2024 as a result of how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) assesses business performance. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, the Medical Surgical Portfolio was separated into two operating segments as a result of the previously contemplated separation of the PMRI businesses, which were previously aggregated based upon similar economic and operating characteristics. In addition, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, there were certain Medical Surgical businesses that were moved to the Other line, which primarily related to wind-down activity of the Company's Renal Care Solutions business that was contributed to Mozarc Medical in April 2023. Subsequently, as a result of the February 2024 decision to exit the Company's ventilator product line and retain and combine the remaining PMRI businesses into one business unit as further discussed in Note 3, the two operating segments within the Medical Surgical Portfolio were combined into one operating segment, and the Company's ventilator product line, which was in the Medical Surgical Portfolio, was moved to the Other line during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the new reporting structure.
The Company's management has chosen to organize the entity based upon therapy solutions provided by each segment. The four principal segments are strategic businesses that are managed separately, as each one develops and manufactures products and provides services oriented toward targeted therapy solutions.
The primary products and services from which the Cardiovascular Portfolio segment derives its revenues include products for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of cardiac rhythm disorders and cardiovascular disease, as well as services to diagnose, treat, and manage heart and vascular-related disorders and diseases.
The primary products and services from which the Neuroscience Portfolio segment derives its revenues include those focused on neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, as well as various areas of the spine and brain, along with pelvic health and conditions of the ear, nose, and throat.
The primary products and services from which the Medical Surgical Portfolio segment derives its revenues include those focused on diseases of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, pelvic region, obesity, and other preventable complications.

Medtronic plc Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
The primary products from which the Diabetes Operating Unit segment derives its revenues include those focused on diabetes management, including insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring systems and sensors, and smart insulin pens.
Segment disclosures are on a performance basis, consistent with internal management reporting. Net sales of the Company's segments include end-customer revenues from the sale of products the segment develops, manufactures, and distributes. Refer to Note 2 for discussion on net sales by segment. There are certain corporate and centralized expenses that are not allocated to the segments. The Company's management evaluates the performance of the segments and allocates resources based on net sales and segment operating profit.
Segment operating profit represents income before income taxes, excluding interest income or expense, amortization of intangible assets, centralized distribution costs, currency impact of remeasurement and hedging, non-operating income or expense items, certain corporate charges, stock-based compensation, and other items not allocated to the segments. Prior period amounts have been recast to reallocate certain expenses from segment operating profit to centralized distribution costs to conform to classifications used in the current year as a result in a change to the segment operating profit metric used by the CODM to assess business performance and allocate resources.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1. Certain depreciable assets may be recorded by one segment, while the depreciation expense is allocated to another segment. The allocation of depreciation expense is based on the proportion of the assets used by each segment.

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are effective.
Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of April 26, 2024. The effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of April 26, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the quarter ended April 26, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Exchange Act Section 3(r) Disclosure As reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, Medtronic has engaged in certain activities that it is required to disclose pursuant to Section 13(r)(1)(D)(ii) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In particular, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, Medtronic engaged in certain regulatory activities involving Russia’s Federal Security Service (“FSB”) related to its medical devices that were expressly authorized by the U.S. Government under applicable economic sanctions regulations.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, in the normal course of business and consistent with the OFAC authorizations as in effect at the time, Medtronic Russia filed a total of one notification with the FSB, as required under local Russian law for the import of medical devices that make use of encryption functionality. These activities did not directly result in any revenues or profits for Medtronic. Medtronic did not engage in these activities during the second, third, and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2024. To the extent that notifications with the FSB remain permissible under U.S. law, Medtronic may decide to continue engaging in such activities for the limited purposes of complying with local law requirements in Russia.
